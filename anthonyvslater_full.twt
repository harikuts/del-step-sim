together tonight and lost those





beal
scored


and now

of
scoring

wiseman right wing
he
hit a

no d

tonight he and
will miss both



an

conversation toward end of the episode
nobody new on the
injury report for tomorrow s rematch




remains out d

listed as questionable

looney franchise vet on a recent conversation with wiseman i
to him a little bit about this role change is kind of what

to do i
t be
if in four five
he
again that s kind of the
way at the center position


i just
the news about
smith i m just
crushing news

been part of the
family for a long time just another awful day and we re all so

crushing news one of the
people in the industry
the
and

a potential deal
kelly


said there
traction as of yet like many
around this time it is a scenario


turner


already is absurd


is the only non center in top
of total

green damn that s crazy the league

new league wide
bouncing all around the west
an interested
curry in


answer on what it was like to face his former franchise a subdued
giving about the
you d expect plus some other
on what s different for him with

to





the
starting

wiseman to the bench for
looney story from a cruise of a win over the




green on thinking about the
first rounder while
them maybe bob i hope no player thinking about that how many
on this team
i bet not more than five people know we have the
pick in this locker room

green on the new starting
tonight which
the
out to a cushion today

it s one game let s not go too crazy

green on
wiseman if he s coming off the bench or not he s one of the most important
on this team

wiseman on sliding to a bench role it s helpful for my development said it
him to watch read the game early see how looney is
and then try to implement it
does even a small part of

think about helping the
draft pick tonight while beating the
yes i
be honest yes yeah why not

on wiseman development
t equal
time or vice
development is something that s
to define sometimes you can learn observing we re
out creative ways to teach him between
his development is happening all the time

get a win for the present and the future tonight improving to

and knocking the
record down to

the rare chance to win and help your draft asset base they
get another chance on

three
and another three
for

tonight up to

on the season sixth in the
behind five
also had

on


in his first career game


fifteen
curry fourth quarter
in

from the

mark to the

mark up to
in the game
sixteen offensive
for the
tonight
still sit
in the
in rebound rate
tiny negative in the first half better in the second half but i like the idea of this curry mulder

wiseman
the
staff
tried tonight
wiseman with curry
still as they want and
floor with an extra quick trigger shooter

just let
curry chill wide open from
on the wing for two full
no help no


pick on
pick
so
be
mulder and
wiseman entering mid first to play next to curry



opening for the looney
pin block and alley
for
in his first career stint against the



speaking for the first time since his lower leg injury extended absence remains ahead still on
not officially
out for the season he s on a one year deal but
to be with
long term i hope so i love being here
they plan to leave on


it s a

game schedule
the
plan to send

jordan
and alen
to the
g league bubble

on wiseman he s still
play plenty expectation is he
enter around
minute mark of first third quarter likely with
to a curry


wiseman


wiseman will now slide into looney s rotation spot entering as the first center at the middle of the first third quarters
will be third center with that second unit still then
said he
see who is
best

on looney for wiseman i m going with my veteran group that group
to be our best defensive five


is
the
starting

looney in place of
wiseman

have
sending

to the upcoming g league bubble in

will have a conversation with staff later today about logistics
i haven t
a full game since march
going down there getting into a flow would be good for me


to some of

early
about the formative basketball
for the
rookie
needs to be noted
are
for
to lose as much as possible even if
finish with
worst record
chance pick
at

and
keep it
the
and
meet twice this week about a year ago they connected on a huge trade
reassess the

for

swap
new
all

with
on the blowout loss to the jazz and the starting


the spotlight is brightening on the
struggling starting
they are a
this season story off a blowout loss in
in which they were

here s


tonight on his struggling starting
which is now
in



green we got to find an identity as a team sometimes we move the ball sometimes we don t sometimes we defend sometimes we don t are we
be a ball movement team or an iso team

miller just hopped on
curry s
zoom call oh curry
he
miller on the all time
point list tonight

curry on the struggling starting
work in progress obviously the

t great just trying to figure it out we do have stuff to figure out obviously i don t have the
right now


about this curry usage
there s a lot that goes in to all that we see all the
and all the
there are plenty of
that we could talk about i m
leave that to you
to assess and figure out
most notable


quote when
about if he remains firm on starting
there s no doubt that we have to assess everything as a staff as an organization how we re looking at this season what our
are everything is up for


fall to a pretty fortunate

considering they re now
through

that s sixth worst in the
ahead of only
magic thunder



are down
at
in


mulder is

from
this season and second unit was a cumulative
in his
bench
before slipping from the rotation for
the last few

it
as a
stint to open the game for the

they re now
together in

early this season


jazz five
for
so far zero for curry
three jazz
two



within


this will be the first game for the
this season with
in attendance jazz allow

in the lower bowl one of six

a spaced out number of
in the building


magic and
in
the other five

curry
been on the court for
of
wiseman s

since his return
green
been on the court for
of wiseman s


if we re going to be a championship contender the next few
those
have to learn to play together


s been going with
ahead of mulder in the rotation lately my philosophy coaching is to never let a guy linger on the bench for too long

had mechanical
with their plane yesterday
t get into salt lake city until
a m

this morning game against the jazz who
won seven straight in



green was yelling at teammate
wiseman the official thought it was directed at him green was
and the
went on to lose to the
quick transparent decision by the league green
money but the loss remains

foul the second most in the
give up second most

they have eight
in top
of
per

it s a problem here s a video breakdown


s ticked off descriptive
last night
clip from last

on the second half rotation

new
all



to discuss
ejection
rotation
early development the loss to the
and more

green was
for talking to
wiseman and the
hacked away a home loss to the
story on an odd night
wiseman on
getting
for yelling at him i was trying to get a post up and he threw it early he was like catch the ball or something like that i guess that s basketball i was confused myself i don t know why the ref did that i don t know
as
as

s been after the
seven
on the fouling maybe it
if a guy
he comes out forget the rotation just take a few
where you reach you come out and we have a bunch of
filing in and out of the game


railing against the

we are raking people across the arms we are
people coming around
it
nothing to do with the
it s us

move to

in chase center s brief history
drop to

this season outplayed before and after the odd
green ejection
haven t won or lost three in a row this season little rhythm to it jazz in
up next
this entire thing is a

masterpiece
the

four
in

five if you include the kent
technical to quote kelly
everything is art depending on the way you look at it
second in the
in
per game

up to
in just over three quarters tonight
assume the

non mop up debut is for offensive organization without
green
objectively bad ejection from official running
green for briefly yelling at wiseman not the ref probably will be
tomorrow but this is also the risk of getting that early first t in any game one ref error away from being


green
two first half
a hurtful ejection he was good in the first half they re trying to gain an early season rhythm and they re in a tight very winnable game


eight first half
for
green he s seventh in the league in
per


just about every offensive possession in this second unit
v
battle should be going through eric

forty first quarter
for the

the
defense they
with the league s fifth worst offense

have faced the
and
the last

the
appear to be the noticeably more
opponent



this season restricted area

percent non ra paint


percent mid range

percent


percent free


percent
no
on the

injury report for the
game tonight no rest
on second night of the home back to back
first month
can swing so wildly
went
of
from deep last night and the

point defense
from
in the
to

this three possession third quarter sequence is what the
want rookie season wiseman to do to

leaves him twice to help two wiseman

stays glued to him to avoid third straight dunk curry floater without help side contest
wrote on
wiseman and the
previously
starting
which had its best night in a blowout of the
a few
stood out

curry said tonight was a sign of maturity for the reformed
the good
can show it from time to time the great
have sustained excellence on both sides of the floor

beat the
by
their most dominant performance of the season current picture of the crowded west ladder


with the league s eighth worst
point defense
are
of
from deep through three quarters
up

nobody
a lighter stretch of the schedule more than
wiseman a coasting

and the
easier to gain traction against than turner

ad

next two

no
next week had a


first half line
rough start for the previously great
unit batch of

three
between




run in three

ever probably
three first quarter
for
wiseman already an early career high
purposefully involved him in more action to open tonight
kelly
in a much better place than a week ago that slump was deep but
over


is active per




been questionable this season three separate times with a quad foot and knee issue
normal stuff
and
he said training staff said
could maybe use a rest night but most high minute
could use a rest here and there


took part in
this morning was listed as questionable with knee soreness

said he
him to play

but final decision after he
up
latest



have a home back to back against the
and
coming up no
to rest anyone on either side of it per


latest league wide

an early season surprise from each of us


all



to discuss the
comeback win over the

here s the
green to
wiseman
turnover the
on court
d up conversation between the two and then green s detailed
explanation on why he
to put wiseman in tough
like that

just came back from
down to beat the
in la story off the game
here s
curry on
wiseman
through the

that
law reference

curry on
wiseman keep giving him
understand they re all learning
you know i used to get
for
law you
be able to take those
in stride and learn

green on the
second unit it s now getting to the point where you expect them to be good you re depending on them to be good it s becoming a staple of this team


said he decided to flip
and
in the rotation the last couple days to get
into that second unit maybe activate him get him more aggressive get him more involved said he
do it again next game

came from
down to beat the
a couple
ago just
from
back to beat the
in la latest chapter in what s been a wild early season
now

as schedule
some

jazz

the next five
kelly
s best game for the
through the first

nineteen
in

for eric
most
time of almost every
game lately is the start of the second fourth quarters when he s scoring regularly
backup

a few out of control
overzealous

switching onto

rough night for wiseman capped by the first cooler whack of his career

go

from
in the first half get beat up

on the offensive glass again wiseman
on
they re
basically
in every minute that
t
small ball down
to the

most notable rotation tweak tonight kelly
in the start of the
unit separating him from
curry basically taking what s been the
role to open


face the
tomorrow

on
they have the confidence that comes with winning a championship and they don t have the fatigue that comes with winning multiple
this is really a sweet spot kind of where we found ourselves the year we won


wiseman s only taken one total
the last four


it s not by design i m fine with him taking
i want him taking
we
just been trying to get him to focus on diving to the rim when he
he
the entire defense with him

will start the same starting
tomorrow



said he
continue to rearrange rotation but
t want to go away from the curry


wiseman unit yet to open

our latest



are currently the worst rebound team in the league
only

percent of

new
all

on the state of the



the

for the
in their loss to the
tonight

curry

with us learning on the fly
missing the first two it s a solid place to be we can play a lot better and hopefully our record will indicate that once we learn our
we need to learn

i guess i do like where we are

curry on the
starting
some good days some bad days it s

in we got to understand what we can do better especially offensively getting into a bit more flow and then living up to that expectation of what we re supposed to be defensively

are a pretty representative

after
roller coaster
three off days before a
meeting in la with the

update


t the problem for the
tonight unit that closed the first third quarter was


are a
in the eight looney


tonight the unit
the first third quarters
been

this possession just
to end in a
green
attempt not a pass
slow motion of that
wiseman dunk over


just an odd defensive half from the
felt like every rotation was one second late
five early offensive
for the

are the sixth worst defensive
team in the


on wiseman guarding
tonight don t bite on the
he s going to try to goad you into
use your advantage which is your length and athleticism more than likely he
learn some hard
tonight but that s what this year is about
mike
on
the
in their

curry

in their
he

in their
he s shooting
percent from
in their
he s shooting
percent another night of get it out of his
attention coming toward curry
the

for
wiseman the next three


the ad

trio

kent

way to get better is to go through it and push through it

first postponement of the season for the


game in phoenix is off due to contact tracing within

with



what we learned about the
during their





five
tonight

curry on box and
we call it the
defense and eventually you think we
be able to pick it apart we need to find some key
and
to create
i have to solve that puzzle so i stay aggressive and don t fall into what it s supposed to do and take me out



with



told
the worst of the

is behind him
he s going to be get into the pool next week and start running in the pool he s very upbeat about everything


on
curry i don t think he s
he s seeing different

are either
out and soft
him or
a box and
a lot of the secondary
we would
got a few
ago we re not quite ready to see that s got to come

wiseman will start the second quarter filling the vacant eric
spot in the second unit this unit had
really well

as a small ball bully against


another early

block
to deflect a

mid range jumper that s

block this season tied for sixth most in
with

and brook



will sit behind the
bench tonight just
from the tunnel first sight of him at a game this season


s been around the
facility the past few days still unlikely he
be traveling with the team any time soon three game road trip to
phoenix

coming up


said they don t anticipate eric
s absence will be long but
t sure yet



will be active for the
tonight


he
likely see some of those vacant




forward eric
is entering the
health and safety
he will miss
game against the
length of absence still to be determined
the lesson for
wiseman last game he
t have to overhelp and try to block everything i can always go back and crack my man and get the rebound full
video clip of the mistake

wiseman
t close either of the last two

we re not
him to change our franchise we re
him to play defense run the floor and get
he s capable of doing all of that

lee s scored the five most important
of the
season so far game winning
in
game winning free
tonight to beat

a terrible fourth quarter and

shooting night from curry the
are



curry
of
shooting
all nine of his
but
up
on the
through three quarters this supporting cast
become increasingly better at
the attention curry is getting into advantageous
on the back side of the possession
this was probably

most encouraging play of the first half seal catch and power finish over smaller

want him to be more consistently physical


a

shot happy
still in a slump wiseman with some wow
and


them missing a bunch of open

looney both listed as questionable tomorrow

foot soreness now for
hip soreness for looney

green on
wiseman he
too
with himself he
so
he kind of
himself out of his game i told him i probably had one of the worst
of my career last night but made some
down the stretch you have to be able to forget


on his starting
i m really
to it because of the potential defensively if we want to be a great defensive team that s the
that
sense i d rather commit to our defense right now and sort out our offense


sat out practice today still nursing that sore quad likely to play tomorrow

play early in his rookie season
penny

green on
wiseman
and

his ass last game in the pick and roll last game he was
off he took on the challenge and he was better tonight he took that personal when a guy
it personal that s great

green said he saw the
pointer coming early

the tendency at times to
around with the basketball there was no
around he came out and everything was shot or attack

green said

jokingly gave
wiseman the game ball in the locker room for his first career double double but that ball went to

more early
wiseman
his size better
green more engaged from the tip

like somewhere in the
minute range for
green tonight
some third quarter frustration from
green last night

him after only four
following his best play of the night steal transition find for curry
just as he said he was starting to find a rhythm here s his


green on kelly

officially calling
wiseman probable tomorrow

with that slight left ankle sprain no other
on the injury report

green i
last night in
people on the floor i

for
wiseman after the ankle roll practiced today fine for tomorrow

green


yesterday

said they
continue to inch that up won t just jump him to
tomorrow night but it should rise
the
currently have the
worst
point offense and the
worst
point defense the defensive side is more concerning story from a blowout loss in



we talk every game about
without fouling and then we foul we mindlessly reach
second in the league in



on wiseman
is fine
his ankle but it s not bad said he
him to play on

alen
right meniscus tear surgery in the coming days
brutal home opener for the
give up

to a
team currently in different conference tier lose by
third blowout l in three

good competition
wiseman
to tweak his ankle late but the
did lose to the


today

are
of
from
against the
leaky defense so far this season that s
percent league worst
defense last season was

percent
this is the version of eric
who can transform the
work in progress second unit

have
nine quarters against
caliber
so far this season the plus minus result


wiseman s jumper an early revelation but he can t fall in love with it those open
are there to attack
first stint together
offense a little haphazard derrick
pressure on curry was
let
get loose for a couple
and they re not missing


tonight
curry kelly



green
wiseman first look at the five man grouping they d been


expect

to be around the team soon



been doing his early
of

privately
i d love to have him up here as much as possible that s the plan
alen
s knee issue still
t
him to practice no firm timetable but

said he won t be
in a game any time soon said the injury
t
well early to treatment


said
green likely won t play much more than

or so short



said both
green and eric
should be good to go tonight green was probable
questionable

really trying to flex on their free throw background



curry on

return tonight

he does well
feel right away energy effort communication

eric
is listed as questionable for the
tomorrow

with right knee soreness

green is
to make his season debut tomorrow he
a big task ahead of him

green is
to make his season debut against the
tomorrow night per
home opener for the

strange road trip for the
they exit with the
worst point differential
but are a somewhat feel good

with a tiny bit of momentum heading home for seven
and a
green return
new

taking a detailed look at their

start

new
all

on the win in




wiseman and the
very interesting

road trip
the
have picked up jordan
third year option deadline was tonight


his
play was pretty impressive in transition
a well

for

tonight in
twenty seven
and they
t quiet his mid road trip improvement is the
reason they re now



took a strange route to it but

was the
outcome on this opening road trip a
win not sure if

will be worse but

more positive
in
than
riding a tiny bit of momentum toward a
game

first
wiseman foul out of his career
with verticality tonight lot of early career

that was a
in seven non curry
to open the fourth quarter for the


most important stretch of his early
career
here is the
long term version of
wiseman length to erase the
floater grab and go skill speed
on the move soaring dunk

we
see the first three


setting a perfect off ball screen setting up a curling
curry

only
first half
for the
only six
curry shot
those
are correlated
obviously swarming him but he s still
force more
up his
need to find him off ball more
first quarter story wiseman
in foul trouble
get crushed on the glass
up five
streak broken kelly

his first
of the season after missing first

a more alert active defensive start for
wiseman but two
in


to the bench unlucky on the knee to knee blake griffin foul but
to stay full vertical on contest for foul



on the
center spot
now
comfortable where
at
said wiseman will get

looney is healthy
will get small ball


soon no immediate need for outside help
same
for the
tonight in

curry kelly






wiseman
weekly
bouncing around to a bunch of league wide

new
plus minus
is up subscribe


said the hope is that
green will make his season debut on
in the home opener
the

part of the
more simplified offense will be plenty of high screen downhill
for

he s an accurate drive and kick passer here are five
from last night


is
the
offense story off their first win of the season

green on the
offense we have to figure out what we have to do different extended
here thought he broke it down pretty well


said he s starting to get a better feel how this new
roster should play offensively he s



finding we need to get more
into high step
getting them downhill spacing the floor full quote


t exactly solve their
tonight in
but avoid the nightmare

start thanks to
curry s

a better version of

sturdy
looney
and a
lee game winning
with


left they re


looney over wiseman to close and it s a practical decision looney s been the noticeably better defender tonight
best of the three
for

and eric
worst of the three
for
wiseman
that s now
straight

for kelly
to open the season

second quarter
for the
hit seven
curry got going a bit at the rim
t
his
but probably his best half so far this season
need more from
wiseman defensively
only six wiseman
the first
available tonight

are leading the
in one

nine more in the first

tonight
through nine quarters the
team
in

a struggling
curry
of


wiseman a rookie center
of


mulder a reserve guard who
t in opening night rotation
of
as a team
of


of


curry now
of
from
over the season s first nine quarters


said eric
could play some small ball center considering current state of
big situation

green
play in
or


said team
to wait until
to get him

more days of
work


said

injury
landing on a lob attempt in a scrimmage

miss him he was
well


green remains out tonight against the

quick reaction to the

injury news
brutal for

found an
rotation home for the
from the team side leaves them with only two healthy


wiseman and
looney
full
green
on
wiseman
an accidental
and a whole lot of praise

green on a media zoom call from his road hotel room distracted mid answer by what he s seeing on his
i m sorry

is a stud that
is really good

green on
wiseman i told y all after day
he was going to be really
special

green said he
today will he play tomorrow i want to said his body
amazing but trying to get his wind back official decision likely not until morning


on the urgency to win in
tomorrow i think that s fair to say but that s more out of frustration we
just gotten our ass
there s no worse feeling


on
wiseman he s clearly the focal point of the future of how we re building this team with


i can now throw
in there
third straight full practice for
green today in


still calling him questionable for tomorrow against
still
likely though
new
all


is up

concerning and what
for the
after two blowout
to start the season

curry on
wiseman we talk about
we need to make hopefully they
let him shine even more as we get in sync

curry on the offensive answer i don t know we just have to focus more on what we re trying to do sometimes when you miss
you tend to force and press and not think our group s collective

to get a lot better in those
where you re not making



on the

early
kelly s going to be fine
s going to be fine they re proven
in this league i
got to do a better job of
them in
to get comfortable


we just had two good days of practice with our execution working on getting into offense hard
and
we did not execute much of anything it was kind of just scattered and
i m disappointed in that and need to take the blame for that

and

for
wiseman his first two


his
are going to bump up said they
have to live with some defensive growing
from a rookie center but likely they
begin to feature him offensively a bit more

more like

than

for the
cumulative
point differential through

quarters
green
soon and more reasonable



to close road trip before
game
awful start but we
know much more in a couple


by quarter against the
defense so far








curry


the season s first seven quarters no other
player with more than four roster
lost so much collective passing instinct ability the last two

green s return will help
ten straight

for kelly
to start the season him
now
of
from deep

a cumulative
through six quarters rough start to the season
down immediate
but
scope the early
wiseman
probably matter more if he s this the equation for the next half decade plus

the

wing
combined through the season s first five quarters
of
shooting
of
from
it s the

early issue

mulder getting first quarter


wiseman s taken six long
in the first five quarters of his career four
two


wiseman already getting a shift guarding
early in this game
alen

the final two
preseason
with a knee issue he s been inactive for the first two
of this season still

no timetable given from

on his opening night dud
a lot of easy


a lot of stuff
fixable i had a couple silly

where i was like
the hell did i miss that
but it

going to be off nights

second straight day


said the
don t yet have a rotation will reward
who play well with more

like he d like to have a firmer rotation

into it but it might be more than


green won t play in
practiced fully today individual session after

the hope is that he
play in
or

the return of the
all


and
join to discuss all that went wrong in the opener wiseman
five

through the
nightmare opener in
what
what
t what s up with

what about that
wiseman debut
nine
wiseman
in just over two mop up
three deep

more confident than i
right away from the outside

wiseman made a
and hit a couple long

him if he
like he s going to continue to shoot a decent volume of
yes i feel good about my shot

wiseman said he felt like he had a good debut but i should
been more aggressive on the
six
in


curry on wiseman twenty four good
to start his career


mulder was great i

people in the first half we don t have a rotation yet we re still in the very early

will be
when they play well
did a good job and we
reward him said he will get a shot


i
t like our level of competition it just felt like we were out there

said at
that they had

on
on

felt like we were backing off

wiseman
a straight on
an
footer from the
and
a lob on three quick
up to
and
in
debut
indictment of
but a
year old
his first game in

was probably their
best player tonight

mulder

a catch and shoot
and then a pump and go up and under

think
get a rotation shot soon
first three quarters of the
season




combined



plucked from replacement starter role after sluggish first half non curry


from

of
shooting below
percent down
out of
against an east contender another
in
three days again in the national spotlight


first half about as
there were young
attached too close to
flew at a pump fake jittery on
but the talent length athleticism
off the screen here was his
move
twelve post trade


for the
last season a few great
a few invisible
none as bad as this first half

green is in a sweat suit
might be the league s best offense this season but still an ugly start for a defense that
it can be top

slow eight rough


the
best defender on
durant so far
looney

were

six straight

to open the season for the
showing the world their
roster flaw early

wiseman s first checked off three
into his career first dunk first
jumper first foul of a
hit
on the arm on a jumper

open with
and


i don t mind at all starting against two of the best
in the league let s take on the best and see where we stand before we push forward

green went through an individual workout yesterday another individual workout tonight

said he
green can practice with the team tomorrow
to seem like it
be a short absence

the
will start
wiseman at center tonight in
no summer league no preseason only a sprinkle of college
but
debut against
and
into the fire

enough in camp and
extremely high on his future
new

but won t reveal yet center is the question
wiseman will debut

after being unavailable in preseason

green is officially
out for tomorrow s opener in


curry on the impending extension deadline nothing to report
here s the full
of

essentially naming
wiseman the
starting center
newsy day for the

green doubtful for the
game with a foot issue
mulder made the roster

basically

wiseman the near immediate starting center all the relevant
in here

officially saying it s a mild muscle strain in
green s right foot

mulder
made the
roster

he s here he s on the
man roster for a reason he s here he s ready to roll and he could find himself out there
night



to praise
wiseman said he s

up rapidly basically
him starting center not running from the growing
but it s one thing to scrimmage it s another to be on the floor against


durant and the





wiseman will be our starting center before not too long said it s clear he s the future at the position might even be on


wiseman
with the
today he had a really good day

said
like he will play in the opener
said he
t decided if he
start yet but it s clear that spot is
for him very soon

green had an
on his foot it s clear


not a long term thing they think he
be available soon perhaps at some point during four game road trip to open season

talker ever


talk because i don t think he

a lot back in the day when he was hooping
kelly

he s a massive individual it
be fun to run be super athletic super versatile out their on the court together i look forward to just throwing it up there to him
front half of clip


the
wiseman


at navy comparison not the all star with the
back half of clip wiseman
to the comparison said he watched
at navy film
here are some
wiseman
from today on his first scrimmage where he
physically and the
curry

that have wow d him

wiseman i feel good really good my body
great it s up to the
and the protocol but my
i feel very good to be honest


said he
t decided on a starting center
t
out
wiseman
on where we are next


wiseman and
green won t play tomorrow
they re not going to play tomorrow
t make sense it d be irresponsible to throw them in a game right now

wiseman and
green went through a full speed
minute scrimmage today first of wiseman s pro career
made some great

his athleticism and speed then was late on some
because he
t experienced what he s looking at before
latest


five
from the
second preseason game

curry on
wiseman extremely high ceiling excited for him to get some reps and be in a game like situation his energy in practice was crazy it was like
a puppy out the cage
rough night from

on down in the
rotation but
curry s night likely over
a readiness for next


in

five
some soft touch

difficult to make any type of assessment on the
season until we
seen
wiseman play an
minute or which version of
green who


a
in
curry s

a quick
in his


on the bench that off number may be the
point of their season can they survive when he

four

for

in this first quarter that s different and a clear emphasis two
for
two
for looney
i get the idea of
looney as a stretch
he s just never successfully hit

of
for his career
of
the last two
as he s tested it out


said
wiseman and
green are still very doubtful for
s preseason finale they
scrimmage tomorrow scrimmage hard on
but

to hold them both



on eric
s knee issue if this were a regular season game he d play it s
a bit likely to practice tomorrow play

s knee issue is a bit worse possible he
both
this week
no eric
or alen
tonight per latest injury report right knee soreness for both
wiseman still out for

dropping in the morning feed to subscribe clip on brad


an entirely different
confidence around the
this training camp
to last their belief in

future is a large part of that
the grab and go push of the
without hesitation is a very small but good sign
here s a good video look into
wiseman s debut practice for the

the
green to
wiseman practice lob that


via


wiseman
like he s ready to debut soon most definitely

green said he even
the
wiseman
today because it was all energy related when you need to tone a guy s energy back you can do that but lethargic laid back
it s very hard to turn their tick up


said
green
really good
really lean
from green s presser


on
wiseman several great
he
to be a very natural screen setter said his screen and dive game
up some wide open
in his first practice

green and
wiseman won t play in
tomorrow
t sound like they re officially
out for
s preseason finale but

they have to get in a full scrimmage before


on
green s return the energy level just
on wiseman s practice debut a couple
came off the floor and shook their head like wow this guy is massive

green if we don t win a title it s unsuccessful

green on
wiseman s first practice he
a
of ground he ran the floor great came up with some offensive
said he was out of position a lot because he was
up a bit all over the place it was great to see all energy related

green i think we can be really good we have to grow a lot it won t be day
we got a lot of
to figure out i definitely have to play well getting back to myself and what s made me in this league

green very much back in his comfortable media setting
his first thought when he saw
as the opener on the
we got a game on my son s fourth birthday that



green my game
pretty good
tighten it back up said he s trying to get his
back said his last
days
but i m here now
i
been training since june for this moment

green
wiseman was all over the place today

wiseman and
green went through practice today with the

talking to the media now

from the
preseason opener over the weekend

the season
all time in
nearly
almost all in his
should rise into the top
with a productive season one of history s most elite
is back
this is part of the
defensive plan with kelly
they want him to hound bother elite on ball

looney
eric
on the
i definitely feel like we re going to play a lot faster we got one of the best
if not the best shooter of all time whatever pace he
at we
match that

curry s minute total will be in the
range for the preseason opener tomorrow

said he
to play curry in all three preseason
probably with a building minute total

green was back on the court today doing individual work same with
wiseman still no team activity

i m watching most in preseason and into the first part of the regular season pace
were
in pace last season
like considering

of personnel they should actively try to be top five
lot of former

all over the facility latest video from practice


chatting with brad
and

taking
wiseman through a shooting routine wiseman s also been watching practice with


ten preseason
to follow for the


wiseman getting up some corner
part of his light
practice work permitted today
green
to advance to this stage tomorrow

green was back in the
facility today able to lift
all both he and wiseman are out on
and may not get a preseason minute in at all


said
wiseman was able to do
and
individual work before practice basically just getting up some
not involved in team activity yet
very notable via

wiseman is back on the court getting in some individual work
some scrimmage footage from day

said
looney will probably start at center in
s preseason opener for the



said the
are getting their wind in
but a lot of
a lot of poor transition defense where we re giving up
behind the play then offensively we have so many new
throwing together that it s going to take time to blend
no huge update but
wiseman watched
practice in the gym for a second straight day still no
green


on
looney three straight days of
a lot of work and he s feeling excellent that s a huge sign for us of a huge guy we can count in a big situation being healthy unlike last year

it at the beginning of this
the

is
up for the season ten second video
of a scrimmage have them in a frenzy basketball starved after nine empty


have gone from league best

to league worst to now league average at the wing that bump from worst to average is the
rotational difference between this season s rotation and last season s even before the curry injury
will the
make the
what would be
a success sixth seed is my threshold here s a full breakdown
a bunch of
scope
talk in here fun
with some

clip from our latest
plus minus
dropping in the morning feed how detrimental is
wiseman s early camp absence
droplet of day
scrimmage footage from the
eric
ripping a rebound leading the break finding
curry
s playmaking
significantly late in his rookie year assist
his last five







green was not yet
to be at the facility watching practice


said
wiseman was able to watch the
practice today from the balcony above the floor big next step in his reintegration process watched the practice with

per



i have confidence that
is going to help us dramatically if his shot is going in or not
him the best defender in the league
sometimes his shot goes in sometimes it
t and we keep winning that s the bottom line
s a winner
the
season opener is two
from tonight in


i doubt in two
we re going to have people ready to play big
so we re going to probably play a lot of people
the
curry









quick glimpse from the
of their first practice scrimmage today
an
to curry to

dunk this is the starting


for a
they believe can thrive in an up tempo setting
the early camp absence of
wiseman is more
than
green wiseman might be missing the five most important
of his rookie season a look at the situation around the


curry on
green we all had a down year last year for him he s going to be that defensive presence and monster we expect him to be you talk about a guy who
what the conversation is around him i m sure he s keeping the receipts
do you like what the
did this summer and do you like where this is heading
curry from what we have now i love where
at full quote

curry on
in a
jersey his whole career that s a huge goal
curry on extension it s just understanding what the landscape is and what the situation is going into the future we want to be competitive we want to be in a situation where we re
for
every single year i want to be a part of it

curry on his extension eligibility we had
everything s on the table i m fully
to his future on the



on
wiseman s absence at start of year
it s unfortunate but it s just the way it goes our coaching staff
been showing him tape the last few days he s still getting some homework in it s not ideal but nothing s ideal for anyone in




green did not practice today either

on the reason for
wiseman s practice absence i will not comment on that any further you can make your own



wiseman did not practice today


said the
two
who return from covid quarantine will need several days before being
to practice i know there s some kind of a cardiogram a heart monitor testing because of the nature of the virus
the
begin group practice today without two
they re unlikely to return to team activity until at least next week the season is
days away this is the first of what
probably be multiple covid related

eric
on
wiseman he s very open to listening that s one thing i

about him not afraid to ask
that s one thing i like about him
eric
said his
pointer
good right now
it a little this summer trying to jump less get a little more arc on it
the calendar version of the first half of the
schedule here
maybe the most meaningful sequence of the
schedule comes in late
they face the
in chase center on

and
remember the
have the
top

first round pick

open on a
game road trip at
at

at
then a
game








kelly
said he s spent his first week learning the
system it
me fast paced basketball lucid basketball we can all play positionless
the
don t open at home until

against the
i m told they
face the
again in the chase center two days later on

every team will have repetitive
this season part of the necessary



curry s usage rate pick and
per game in

to look more like




by about this side by side muscle watch photo that had some people talking yesterday put on a couple
just a few

out the path for one more
curry
season it s there three
need to happen

curry said
wiseman can for sure contribute significantly right away we have to have grace with that success for him will be framed a lot of different ways it might not be what the
look like it might be being part of meaningful basketball helping us win
does
curry expect to run more p

this year i m sure that
be a part of it coach will have
i
have
said it s about
space whether that s pick and roll every other possession or our motion offense we

last season and how high he
it can go
allow me to show you sir i can t really predict the future allow me to show you
kelly
is on an expiring deal i m optimistic i definitely feel see myself being able to fit in and make myself a home with the

note within this the

bob
said he got a call from

was driving home from gym he got

wiseman on his new point guard i have a great relationship with
obviously i went to his camp while in high school he taught me a lot about the game of basketball gave me a lot of information that s my guy

wiseman said he spent part of this long layoff watching
film

how the
play watching
being

were a bottom

an injection of athleticism size length wiseman immediately
them that they warmed to him in recent

the timing on this

are about

from making one of the more monumental
for the franchise for the next decade the entire
is at the facility in the war room together
only bit of word i
gotten out of the

too early
get the increasing sense that the big swing factor tonight at the top of the draft is whether the

very little sense for the

away is anyone
business as usual by then


s been clear the
preference is a

in the bay area behind closed
with his
included not a summer league across the country that very likely
t include





s
surgery was exactly one year ago today the gap from surgery to his return to an
court will be at least



probably the preference because he s a proven fit in the system locker room but the point you
ability to

to the
on defense is not an unimportant bonus


on that crazy

series from a year ago with

the transaction window deadline will come and go tonight without the
filling a vacant roster spot
told no
money to offer for next season no

target for the

a longer conversation about why again i just
see the
shopping

link

have two available roster
this week but can only fill one while

was thinking this morning about when
durant
and how long it took him to acclimate to our style of play it was probably three




around the
for a fourth straight day spotted after practice in the weight room chatting with




yet know a
day without his former coach around
five
the

lob
the

tribute the

loss



eight lob
in the two
since he
his
year deal with the
here are all eight

loss of the season for the

a sub
record
upside down





















fifteen loud third quarter
for

after a silent first half
won the quarter by
enter the fourth down eight to the heat


tribute video plus a

speech plus
taking the



on his summer trade from the

had a
moment i think i
it out

the podium
a soon to speak

at chase center

green on the trade
a great situation for both sides for where
is at in his career and what he needs i think
the perfect situation and for where
is at and what he needs i think this is the perfect situation


green on seeing

tonight

flagrant foul him flagrant


joe
on the
for
swap and everything that comes with it

green not on injury report
heat tomorrow it
be his first game with



yesterday to have your power forward be your leading assist guy is a rarity in the

important for
to feel what that s like

from a longer term view most important thing

did last night was defend

and

well they may need him to play small ball
in the future clips in here
in his debut


like a perfectly capable part of the
future
new

the

debut with



we lost a lot in
so coming here being part of a winning culture it s different losing s never fun being here you can tell by everyone s attitude approach everything that s everywhere they re
that s something i

to be


on

debut
good to have a player who we can put on
and at least match up physically



gave
solid
in his
debut contract will always linger over him but
all
really
next season thirty consistently decent wing
on a nightly basis


debut half for the


a couple

t get a rebound
that slashing scoring ability hit a couple

into the periphery for
but had

twenty first half
from

who
into a more firm future with the
yesterday


first
as a
starter
might get some alen
tonight

he
up as the
backup
now that green is resting

green
now been
out tonight

with lower back tightness eric
starting in his place
about to hop on to talk
and

after the break

curry wore a

jersey to
game



starting
tonight
bowman
lee


green


per source

will make his
debut tonight
in chase center on
against the


on
trade there s very few
in the draft according to
and very few of them available in free agency
are hard to come by just by
in a positional fit a guy who
a lot of talent i think the move
sense
bob

still going to spend a lot i still foresee some good spending ahead but there are
where you have to be responsible and say
look we can do this
going to be a short term pain but provide more optionality moving forward

should the
be getting any heat for so frantically ducking the luxury tax
bob
on motivation to duck tax
see the
of being a repeater the level we
been the
got pretty high if we

in top five the
the
player exception all of a sudden
talking high
millions




the idea that

will slide into a

like role for the

difference is
was so physically strong we could play him at the four and he could guard
and




might debut tomorrow for the
against the

still to clear though




on


be blunt the fit was questionable when we
him from a positional standpoint
full quote


goes in depth on the

fit
the positional difference
from guard to wing
was important part of
for
swap
front office
told him
a thin draft free agency class for

next stage of


testing that surgically
left hand on off ball tug

and

give their most memorable




was
when bob
first met him it was in arn
s office
was wearing a joe montana throwback jersey he told
he d win

and then finish his career in
some quick
reflection from the


the large video board outside chase center
bob
said he just
to


were in the middle of practice when

news broke everyone in practice just stopped when they
the news they just stopped

were
when the news of

s death broke they
off practice
media availability like every emotionally

franchise right now a ton of people in the organization were connected to him in various ways
new


to break down the willie
stein trade
willie
stein
around the
facility
tying up some loose logistical
saying bye to

and

willie
stein
with the
to benefit from
curry s gravity the result four total
together before curry got hurt zero lob
on the experiment that never was and the
motivation to trade
to


make

but still lose to the
they
weirdly lost all seven
this season that they
made

record now

up next
game road trip to
boston
d c and


make an
low

per game have already made
in three quarters

tonight eight from d

it s why they re still in it but
shooting



struggling
defense

in three quarters up

early domino of the
trade eric

early for

alongside
green


more of an opportunity to get a look at the






trade deadline reaction why did the
give away willie
stein for a late second rounder


will start at center tonight

likely starter moving forward now that

been
but

who will inherit more
may get some
in certain


now have a vacant
roster spot they can fill and will soon also have a vacant
spot to offer once it
under the hard cap for
bowman or someone else of their choosing

don t have their own

in




or
so the

at least
them minor asset but it
be in

range most important ripple again is freeing up current roster spot shedding
player option
most important ripple effect from a
perspective
up a roster spot for next season
stein had a player option

to create more flexibility heading into the summer
five
the


in this

slog of a season
new
what remains of interest about this
season
to discuss

came over and said

how we all feel

best game as a warrior up to


plus made some important defensive

is going i mean at least my
are well
i haven t seen you
in a long time you re welcome for me being here today



in three
against the

all three


lost nine in a row


falling to the worst record in the



said he

out
this season but will be patient
may not have seen me much but
been working
full quote on his
update here

injury via took a

elbow right to the face
to the court stayed down several
took a slow wobbly walk to locker room



been down for several

just beat the
bumping their record to

dragging them into a tie with the

halfway point


just
up in the
locker room to

officially sign until tomorrow probably
practice save two way days but
back


is now past the six month mark since his
surgery
a


on

progress
pretty far down the path
starting to to feel that the routine is

out on the floor more

the
are doing some complicated deliberately timed
on the back end of their roster here s an attempt to explain it as simply as possible
i d expect this to potentially eat more into
stein s
since
left


the starting c spot and
well i don t expect him to lose it

probably fighting for backup c

with
days left on his two way deal and some select travel practice days to maneuver around
could conceivably use
up to early march
when they finally slip under a hard cap restriction
them to sign a
man
and add him back to full roster

will have
days of eligibility
on a pro rated two way deal

lee still listed as out for tomorrow s home game

as
inch a bit more below the hard cap should be his last game
before

deal team needs to get him on roster by
to add another two way player in place
five
learned about the
in the first half of the season
the halfway point
just finished their
game of the season they lost in

for new starting center

his sixth straight game in double

made

his last five


returned scored

down one at half in


lee is out of
way days
play in
today
will sign him to full roster by
but doing some cap
now keeping
on roster current number
them a tiny bit further under hard cap each day helping later this season
biggest story of the week for the


obvious quick progress
long back and forth with

on

who is pushing his way into the starting center role and is now up over
percent from
this season

stuck with the
up
entering fourth just like they stuck with the
a couple nights
but ultimately lose again forty

negative on the right thumb
tomorrow

significantly more dangerous at home stick in it with the

they re

calling it a right thumb sprain for d

won t return tonight but not a break fracture
d


t
from the locker room yet been back there getting his right thumb checked since the middle of the third quarter bob
went back there about five
ago

now the
training staff is working on eric
s right hand on the sideline


to the locker room a spooky recurrence for these



is getting his right thumb worked on by the

been
him the last few

eric

grant
every time the
match the two up

to rev up against

higher than him
went





with the league s best offensive rating



with the league s worst defensive rating

been a mantra
not sure we did that once tonight

an
worst

up next the
best


on



for the
in three quarters on


already the seventh time in

the league worst
defense
given up
in first three quarters
eric
making about
play per night right now that
up what you believe is his offensive ceiling

only


in the first half and they got seven of them back
only had
total


need eric
to remain
shot per night aggressive even with

back


might be able to play tonight took part in
in la would give the
a
body
no surgery
for
lee the
expect
be a pretty quick recovery probably just a few
before
back on the court
how can
green
in this new low
environment not
to his game
maximize this strange season


an in depth answer
injury


still a couple
away
looney doing individual work
remains unknown alen
told

he
today so ankle is slowly improving

doubtful


will likely only have

in la
side story on this
lee injury he
accumulate time toward his
day limit while
they were going to be forced to make a roster decision at some point they want lee full time that decision is now
further into future
another blow to
thinning roster
lee had been getting

on the wing
a shooter broke his shooting hand
d


been

mostly from the outside this season in his eight
restricted area
of

non ra paint
of

mid range
of

from three

in the paint
outside it
last night
green returned to a
offense unlike the one he is familiar he and


the
adjustment
new
big picture
talk with
five
the
current defensive rating

is identical to the worst defensive rating in
history
last season much more

green said pick and roll coverage is the worst aspect of the
defense right now but

the last month

we
stop you in the pick and roll


green on the ejection i disagreed with the call and i
never let a grown man tell me not to talk

bowman both hit a couple

still
defensively in quiet building only up one on a
team they can t recognize


on eric
defense
got the speed and quickness to stay in front of a guard and obviously the strength and size to stay with a big guy down low we feel like he can be maybe even a little like p j tucker
be a good
for him


announce the testing on

neuropathy was encouraging and they believe he can return at some point in near future but rule him out for at least two more


be a level up test for eric
tonight going against p j

a lot of muscle

to label you when you re down when you re losing that s easy it s easy to go on
and say whatever you want it s easy to throw darts at a team trying to figure it out say whatever you want to fill that
hour news cycle it s cool with us

green
we got a lot of young
you got to lead them a way the first couple
i led them the wrong way


green
i said we
last night a lot of people

never

have received this season made a huge difference

best quarter of early season included three jordan

in the opening

green leading the best four

jordan


and
green
about to hop on to talk

full

quote pushing back against the idea of

curry in a ton of high ball
to solve the
offensive

should

crank

usage
could turn him into
harden and give him the ball every play but
hard to do you have to build a team for that i
think the answer is just run a million high
we
really have the personnel for that

still no alec
tonight
all three

with ankle sprain
went in depth on the
current situation with

even judge our offense because
taking the ball out of the basket every possession

suck right now we just not that good right now i
know what better way to frame it i can try in

hesitate to throw eric on some of those

he s ready to defend right now

thought


well on these two preseason



on the
defense
stuff we
understand how many
do we have who are under
eight nine young
usually struggle defensively i
think
going to be any exception

question of the season can the
avoid
a bottom
defense

green said


well in practice this week so he told him
you
me you can defend i
know you could so
the expectation now


green
about growing skepticism
will make
stemming in part from their preseason performance

take much from preseason i
even really play that hard in preseason


green
his realistic

defense entering the season

absolutely

in this interview twenty funny pretty interesting


the

on the
all

last night
five
we learned about the new look
in the preseason
new

to recap the preseason what d we learn about the


curry decided to do media in front of

locker tonight
him what
been like
to basketball life without him in the backcourt


noted

s unique style of coaching first thing we did when we got to training camp was watch four or five clips of football
getting beat over the top he said you
are laughing but we should never get beat like this

curry s preseason is done

on
a


percentage line

tonight
it
we know

of the start of
quarter
quarter unit to open season d



jordan
and
green
looney s return on
would likely push
out alec
could factor into

first technical in the chase center
green
been a very positive preseason for jordan
and eric
the
two rotation


have given up

the first


to this
starting

rough first few
for newly





charge on

on
alley


looney will scrimmage early next week and if all goes well he will be available opening night


will open the season as the
starting small forward
this was


for
move but tried to explain the rationale


is still only

eight
younger than one of the


that beyond just immediate need is why they picked him over

willie
stein out on the court after
starting a light workout first time
seen him go through court work since foot sprain


contract was converted from an exhibit
to a non
deal
told so
maintain same flexibility they previously had on
and final usable spot
guarantee for season until early

the
for
swap now
the
nine out of
new
and eight age
or under
an hour plus of
talk with to lead off this


preseason defensive rating


offensive rating




with curry on floor
the preseason is going pretty poorly for the injured



green on


one ever
the situation they blame the
no one ever
these

no phoenix writer is going to bash the
but
be frank when he was there the organization was terrible

is it hard for
green to stay patient through this

it is what it is not being patient

speed it up

eight
all
for jordan
tonight made two six of six on

a
first half in a mostly
preseason for



by the

to find j
reminder to those
by
interior ineptitude
looney and willie
stein the two

to get just about all the center
this season have
zero the entire preseason

green only took seven
combined the first two preseason
came out
tonight nine first quarter
only made two
rough first stint in this curry less game for d

had a nice pocket pass on possession
and hit a mid ranger but
his other four
turned it over twice got beat a couple times and left with
down




will operate in probably
p

this season most often at start of

quarters did it successfully with

here expect it most with willie
stein


on

very different defensive challenge this season


will start at small forward

is feeling ill alec
still out with ankle sprain


is starting for the resting
curry tonight

should initiate much of the offense but
is considered backup


tentative plan is to play
preseason finale at home

as a dress rehearsal



for curry

regular rotation around them

looney will not play the rest of the week did practice today
is that looney will be available in season opener

after his ankle sprain not just a week thing



he only
to play the main
about

in the preseason opener tomorrow


new from



did a mock game in chase center last night the team is
for the first time on the arena floor right now it
tomorrow night in

problem at the center spot

at


looney
a hamstring strain

being careful alen
getting
on ankle now
eric
said
had to play some center in practice the past couple days because of the
injured
undersized but
he could do it in


occasionally in college one time against
fall he said

curry


yesterday
a little heartfelt moment said i miss you



curry
he and

have made a rule whoever
or is
to defensive rebound
on the ball the other
possession off ball

looney riding the bike post practice hamstring issue
seem to be too concerning
alen
also rolled his ankle today three of the
four
currently out only

fully healthy

looney
his hamstring at practice today told

he
think
bad but with willie
stein out center spot getting
thin

radio news
new

to give some early
from
training camp
for the first time in his six
coaching the


won t have

next to him during
a
look at the
staff rearrangement
with rob
coaching
shifting
limited road

collins will take over more control of the
defense this season


on his young team
just practiced for two and a half
we never did that last year

it would appear that

took the ferry to work on the
first day of practice in san

the
enter this season thin in proven
rotation
before their first practice
already lost one for a chunk of the early season
willie
stein said he was
pick up went up for a lob and came down awkward on his left foot mid foot sprain
been told to stay off it for the month of



said pretty soon he should start moving around pretty good not running yet


said he s done his due diligence


won t rush back
he won t try to beat
and will sit until at least all star break if not beyond i m going to do what the team



summer extension stripped away what
been a year of free agency speculation

myself want to come into the season with all that kind of becomes a headache


green
the new
law
by

someone needs to force this dictatorship to change the
is a dictatorship

green s example of his aging place on this
roster

had a concert at chase center last week he had a suite she s a legend he said
some of the younger
to come they
t interested
t know her music




over the next five
in one picture


on the trade from
to the

willie
stein is on
and in a walking boot may be awhile until he
for the



said in summer league he was

today he weighed in at

he
to get to

jordan
when on the court will be used in some of

s pet off ball
said he s been working with the coaching staff on curling around
catch and shoot action



the
will remake their defensive system when you look at the number of wing
we
lost



that was our wing defensive core it
look different we can t play the way we

we have to be imaginative


yeah
looney probably
at center with
out alen
and

really the only other early season

i had big
for looney anyway
the
already ruling

out until at least the all star break
he
miss at least the first


willie
stein
a left foot strain during a recent workout will miss training camp bob
said
the big man situation but likely

looney the starting center job
bob
said

is doing fine but the
won t give a real update until the all star break
as training camp
the
must face a patient reality the
title is a more realistic goal than the
one this season everything should be
through a long term lens
the
biggest big picture
the
face entering this transitional season
will
looney finally start taking
this season

gave me the green light well he gave me the green light before but this one it
a little different
of note
costal cartilage fracture took a couple
to properly heal he was only
for full contact
on
a couple
ago
sat down with
looney who
become a great interview he
that painful
injury the free agency moment he thought his
career might be over and more
in limited duty

made

last season all quick trigger catch and
he was
of
from the right corner he s on the
now he s got a chance to play a role for us we probably
had that since mo





a name for you to watch in
training camp

he

can play a mo
type role for them
i hear it s a non
camp invite for

don t really have room for
man hard cap but
very likely to remain on roster
a non
deal and other
could be shed if





sure we have to tweak the offense i
think
going to look drastically different but when you lose continuity
more important to have
and
random stuff
more difficult if you
know each other



on
s recent comment that the
offense only works to a certain point needing more individual

in the
i
t at all offended at what
said because it s basically the truth
