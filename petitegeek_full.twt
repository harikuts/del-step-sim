interested in
up your ai
for
in industry check out s visual
and big data professional master s program
open until

more

super excited that my colleague mo

been
as a canada
ai chair he is an amazing
professor and a collaborator who s a joy to work with
thank you to for helping form the original outreach idea for her amazing work on making it accessible and visible to

and the original
pilot

and

my computer science teaching

hit
high school teacher
thank you for
it in your community
should be accessible fun
build solid

i offer my
to
curriculum free to all


the goal of the first
course should be to promote confidence if we are going to increase diversity in
thanks for

deep
baby my one year old saying water

with a near perfect success rate cute but annoying when she s thirsty and i can t get the
cup to her fast enough
if you are in a situation where you cannot afford to buy a book on data science e g your country s currency
it infeasible you can
for a copy check out her thread and the book s great looking table of contents
example


glad to hear the idea

thinking about writing a textbook to teach
to code but with ai and interactive

what s the best
platform these days



as someone who grew up not

this is a fascinating and hilarious thread
and i would add that predictive ai must be reliable enough to be able to take action on its result
predictive ai
t bring value unless there is an action it can be associated with
inspiring



thank you
neat was the speed dating

zoom breakout
or some special platform
i
go first i like short sessions that i can sign up specifically for and those that happen during my work day not in the early morning when i don t have

also
open if you d like to tell me privately

poll
with small
have you had a virtual conference experience that you
if so what was special in how it was organized if not what would you want to change
agreed
thanks
the program
great


anyone had a virtual conference experience that you
if so what was special in how it was organized
excited to see my
present their work on investigating the role of culture on negative emotional
in the wild at the affective
perception workshop tomorrow see you there
i d suggest

on the entire video for the most impact and

thanks for

in my
i often show the attached picture to suggest that moving
and
are not what s important but anthropomorphism i say a machine able to perceive and act on its environment or a machine with human or animal


bahar
i will refer for this question



and i see
are
now will check it out
huge
to my student
mina
for successfully
her thesis on emotional body language synthesis for humanoid
so
of her accomplishment

to
based for their
robot
read about the program i
been

for the last

love running the initiative here in canada and seeing these
grow
many thanks

to have computer vision expert speak to our cohort of ai
this morning what an inspiration to our
young
next up is angel chang who will give an
to
tomorrow check for the


you two
if you re serious please keep us in mind come
season this fall we re just across the border
took some time in my machine learning lecture today to talk about
for
and model
for model
by are you teaching your
this

as she
grown up during a very confined time covid i know her input space
been limited to only
specific people and their
maybe a timely topic for developmental



social
say there is at least some learning of
can we deliberately reduce training
of the no face to stamp it out could overwhelming her
with other
in the distress context change how she
distress


both
occur when she
something and needs help she is clearly testing the
out to see which one works best to optimize her goal of getting what she



expression




terrifying from a baby did she learn this from when the
parent
no


expression
sad

looking straight into my
did she learn this from me


yesterday my
year old

negative facial
i
never seen before until now she s expressed distress through crying
not directed at anyone now she s trying out two different
as deliberate socially communicative
to elicit help


these ai exploration and ethics
here look great
middle

in my network
psychology
have historically used emotion induction
to gather emotional data in lab
research however
data is no longer considered a viable source of data by the affective science community unfortunately not everyone
got the

certainly good for talking to
across
i don t like taking air travel to
climate issue so twitter is how i connect in lieu
yep
hi i just found your
poster on topic
thanks to would you have any further
on that project context is so important in my field human robot
affective
and your work is intriguing



on such an important problem would you have a preprint or
link
i say this as someone whose thesis was
about dynamics in music movement voice
just
t cut it
thanks for

would it be great if we could publish
in this instead

and
would be so illustrative for affective

and any other field where static
don t quite convey enough
i use canvas discussion feature and they simply have to post a short reflection about their activity to get a
point mark i don t track

or ask for more as my ta s have said it
to
participation rather than spark sincere discussion
one of the most useful
i

in a while
will add it to their
thanks

here s the outline i am also
the new
book as support material so excited about that
no exam this term but

and a final group project
will necessarily be done as
perception
finally the content

two
hour
and weekly activity e g annotation task i
directly support the
project
as for content i worked backwards what do i want the
to be able to do at the end of the course then i design the
which will reinforce those learning

sure i m doing
real time
per week interactive and
no video just
with my voice and all student video audio is disabled i ask
sometimes and
reply in the chat a ta
and

from
at pause

not this term but i may consider it for the future



to free annotate
in a video clip of their choice
by their
on the task immediately realizing how difficult it would be for
to do what they did e g the literal scene is not sad but the implication of the scene is
i think so let s see if the momentum can continue through the semester thanks for the
you have me from your own experience it


first lecture of my new affective
course starting in a few





by not
my video and making copious use of

and yes i still remember your course well there is a reason i do
now
i
been quiet for the last while with the birth of my baby who is now almost

old current challenge is the noisy reward signal me i need to try not to laugh when she does something she s not supposed to
invent the future our ai
summer program for


high school
will be

this year we welcome
from all across canada spread the word apply by may
early admission or

interesting out of curiosity do you know how your
take
during lecture do you provide the
beforehand and they annotate i think you used to provide
up
with
next to the
for

neat
is this a mock up or is this a feature in

so good
out of curiosity what s discovery research look like
in my course i am thinking to offer two
of
one in which they recruit
on line and use

but it might be tricky to compare the
between them so i m still
over this too
one minute summary is a great idea are the
still going to need

super thanks
first love the
outline one question i have is how to work in student

into the final exam if the
already have a list of
that are possible could that be easy to
f and search for the final
definitely interesting especially if your solution is ready to go of the box
hung out in for the first time a couple nights ago
a
not
and it was awesome here s a primer to get
no headset
see you on the inside

your course

screen capture
is free for academic
till june
follow for more
on
instruction
the
conference
been happening virtually for the last


amazing worth a read also business opportunity
and


this would be huge step towards reducing our carbon footprint as
see for more

thanks for
me
calling computer
with experience in affect a
yr
opportunity in
with a fantastic prof

any video up yet also related from
last year by
yes pepper with
and this
this thread three inspiring computer
who have made a huge difference in

into the field love it thank you for all you
done
can t wait to read it
have
i get this
this is awesome
this is horrific and a nightmare for
everywhere let me know if i can help in any way
link to the petition
is there any progress on
technology like this at the federal level do we need to be
school
for
in the

anonymous tell me what you really think about me
like are
bullying in
profiting off psychological
to the
please pivot and do something else with your time rather than torture

your
is supposedly
but is still marked as teen on the play store




another great discovery was
nominated
at the

in their album chain tripping were
from a model trained on their previous decade of

from all the
of
that

and

i
seeing your work yesterday it is gorgeous i m a local
here in
when is your next showing
i
real hard thanks so much for making this happen
shameless plug for
if you



science is
for tenure track faculty
feel free to ping me if you have

go to the coal harbour
terminal gift shop under
club and play with pepper robot
thank you
i
found the
and presentation sorry for the noise

all the
are
and
while
and

are also available thanks to the
for making this conference so accessible
great talk on fairness and representation learning
below
thank you for your tutorial this morning you
the
would be
would you mind
the link here thank you
great linked
from his
e g

with a talk by about
two
closer together
coffee or brunch at botanist across from the convention
spa utopia underneath canada place i live here feel free to ask anything
according to the abstract we
air travel behaviour at different career
and found that
at the start of their
were responsible for

from air travel than senior

here is the paper they did find a relationship however between travel and salary i have turned down
to reduce my
each potentially a line on my
perhaps tenure and promotion
could take other
of impact into account
can we fly less and still be successful in
a study among

at
found no correlation between travel frequency and h index


canada doctoral exchange program open for
until


i was so excited when

their cloud
to view analyze

but it
they re gone now i wonder what
maybe privacy or
are just too heavy to put
or
bag testing only works if only doing perception though eh not if you wish to test some closed loop with actuation
sure

in person but here s a decent link the key is to be consistent in making the sign and following it with the action referent not
it to ask

thanks
today i took a sign language class to learn to communicate with my baby before she can speak fascinating if she can show she
a mind early if i
t take this class and she
t sign would those
still exist how would you know

human cognitive
which might be useful for ai which might we want to avoid
i m not sure but it does remind me of generalization and how more

in
can lead to
ie more emphasis on pattern matching and loss of generalization ability
many interesting
from
baron
s talk on autism more
and
present in brains of autistic





thanks to
for recording and posting their keynote
on emotion and affective
more academic
should do this it
accessibility for people who can t travel due to visa cost personal and even climate change




science is recruiting for tenure track faculty
here in beautiful
canada join us
nice

a thread here
i actually haven t but will try to get a hold of it thanks
yes and on that note absolutely fascinating is how animal training works this book is great don t shoot the dog the new art of teaching and training
not specifically ai but this pop
book was also on my bookshelf very early on re reading it now the
feel a bit old hat but might be relevant for
the scientist in the crib what early learning
us about the mind
what other
would you recommend to gain some historical context of developmental psych and its relation to ai
i
this book during my early ai
mind design
philosophy psychology and artificial intelligence
one interesting theory i

is that because
is unpaid
s work in general as an extension is not valued the thought then goes that turning home
into
work could have knock on effects on the salary gap at a societal level
got it the other thing then is to show a natural progression from your previous experience so not just an interesting topic but showing that you re right person to investigate it
i think i might be confused about the kind of
you mean though can you give an example
some good advice i received recently about
look at the term of the grant



how feasible is your research plan within that

thank you
this one is
by the
foundation
what would you recommend thanks
that
fantastic
if i haven t seen you in person in a while this is partly why but hey we have twitter right
yes and generally the idea that

is considered youthful looking
this is really interesting is it a recent trend

thanks for posting it
like the
part is being social among remote
some sort of international ice breaker activity
in order

ugh perhaps it s because of the quality of the transmission would they accept if it was
quality
as a computer scientist also often
to give



that thanks
not cold turkey but i m trying to be very selective about it
same here i had my story put into the
star and while i hope people read it i also feel hesitant about sending it to my high flying
and

see

you can do
are they flying for vacation maybe suggest
that are closer to come
our
week old just gave us her first social smile yesterday bliss d now going to read the development of the social smile while she
oh wait she s crying
check out s
and also anil seth s

neat thanks so
like trash can is on the side of the movie theater not in the middle i wonder if

interior

together
segmented and
could be used to generate novel
not my field but would be super interesting

anyone used the
data to generate a
like

world
love the slide on explainable
going to read the

paper
how much granularity of motion do you need just need to speak through the robot with animated speech or point look at specific


yah i can t really think of
better than introduction to
faculty save for maybe senior
who have just gone through all the material
yes we need fundamentally new ways to approach emotion inference in machine learning why i returned to
from industry
very interesting result that could be used for
huh head nodding for virtual
and humanoid


thanks for
yes it s a hard thing to ask
to do i agree for some flying is very important to their livelihood more than for


hi
not
anyone to do anything just telling my story now i think before i fly is thinking before doing something so terrible i have lots more time to do research now instead of
from jet lag
perhaps in the same way that job
would see more
from male
with the same
as female
the latter needing to fulfill
of
before

if you have any
that you d recommend to read cite please feel free to let me know i m very interested in how context can change the perception of
and anything else related to emotion recognition in the wild
your research is directly applicable to our computational work thank you

in
male
use parental leave to get ahead on their research
do this other job during parental leave and instead of accelerate their research lose momentum and then we see this from my field of computer science

thank you

de te


so


of
per paper sending
to present the
at a conference is another


thanks to


like u
is one of the few
running

for a boom in a few
when these

hit university
agreed
like are working to change this


domestic and foreign fuel have roughly the same carbon footprint how can this be true does this account for both
and
internationally
nationally
is it similar to speaking a foreign language or native language or does it depend on fluency in the
language

sense
loving this so we don t have to go as far as sentiment analysis of the text is the intuition behind this that certain
have an inherent valence e g

you smile or
kiki

thanks
dear

do any of you teach an affective
course graduate or undergraduate level if so what textbook might you recommend
handbook
any
of


wish i could see it any chance you will post the


thanks

thanks so much for looking into it

i so wish i could attend new baby on the way i wonder if the
would consider streaming or recording
if the
give their consent

which don t have a paper to reference
parent infant synchrony is important for empathy development but i wonder how synchrony is measured the
system
useful
there might be enough data on the
top

for
finland
to make
fascinating i
done a bit of computational work on
and it s links to music glad to see your work here in canada on this
thank you definitely looking for some kind of data collection or research question to casually investigate invasive video data collection probably not something
maybe like a facial feature detector over time
have you thought about how your work could feed into

s culture and emotion work i e low arousal positive in east


high arousal positive in western


with baby
due in june i might be
more developmental
and
over the next little while here s a neat one surely there s a link between this an emotion regulation development effects of singing style on
and

yeah i m

pregnant
by the way there s plenty of work among brains
and

also of note the coma recovery scale
i want to read more about this if anyone can point me to cool

yesterday it hit me that birth is the opposite of death instead of a consciousness being extinguished a consciousness
to exist in the womb the fetus is
by the placenta when the umbilical cord is cut sedation
and the baby

interested in the preprint too already on


and for your awesome
over the last


thanks
another friend is
about ai
for

old
did you come up with any other cool



and
please pass along this great opportunity we have here in western canada
fantastic
a plug for my husband s company which is
here in


yes the
effect
the face
t everything
where context can completely change
emotion at


s
this in depth
lots of different
too so they learn what it
to learn generalize and what precision and recall are
also i do this
on activity with
to learn
from the
written language
on one side

on the other i tell the
to learn the

given a training set and see how accurate they are on a test set
lots of accessible ai education here



miss you

excellent news welcome to



recently ranked in top

in canada one of only two in


happy to have done this

on
workshop with these fantastic
at the local library i m sure they will remember this day for a long time thanks
nice little
to ai
for
in finland very accessible
a
environment to learn like a child we would then need to simulate the
how can we do that
in

any hardware
willing to give advice to this
grade first
team
do you know anyone in the faculty of environment who d like to discuss this as a
project at
i m a prof at
in
and my
have made a similar food
calculator mobile


a position paper would be welcome as long as it
a computational component for example see the best paper from the last
on the ordinal nature of

if you work at the intersection of emotion and
consider
a paper to our affective
for all special session at
in
deadline



could you do a post on top
carbon footprint friendly
to travel honestly looking for

so glad to hear it yes of course
i find that
on the technology they built is most important rather than just listing up bios but when
the tech include a picture of the woman behind it
and



original
founder and



definitely check out


s profile speaking of role

role
show
of
of diligent
fetch
i have
on my
you can use too pepper is pretty convincing too

san posted more
to his public
there is even a carrying case

thanks for your reply i see your point about
the
and the damage the book did it is clear in hindsight and this point i take perhaps it s simply
that conflate
and her that i took offense to
i tend to dislike

in tech it s hard enough as it is she does not equal
why go after the female
and not the
while i
can t defend
s
her book was interesting and her husband s death just after



my initial reaction was
they are completely
the huge thing on it s head but honestly the
are so captivating it just

after watching the
for a bit
i
t
of that before interesting i thought it might also be linked to emotion regulation for example when we get too sad we laugh or when we get too happy we cry maybe when we get too cute


us to protect care for we go opposite eat it

they call it a sensor horn
agreed too
but they do have some
its on the
page only

stand the cuteness of the new
robot especially the clothing line and pair mode sleeping i think the expressivity in the
is my
part though

your
article series this information needs to get out there
wonderful

imagine not being able to work interact with people or feel that you re
to society now imagine there s a way you could do all those

this is amazing
up while reading it
similar elsewhere to be more clear its the ecological footprint
greenhouse
and land
to generate the food one of the
is to reduce our current need of


to
earth
in
nearly half of our individual carbon footprint comes from food today


a
diet calculator and low carbon meal

thanks
oh the soy sauce and vinegar thing i also add sugar almost forgot

with
carrot zucchini and tofu

a little soy sauce and vinegar or a sweet
sauce is good on top with sesame


reps can screen
for you to make sure they are worth your time
potential impact they also do
on the
and media company to check whether they might misquote you you can also hire a speaker agency which works on commission
yeah it was an interesting choice of title
designing emotionally sentient


ne
plus sur


vis

canada

i often show this video and point out the robot controller sitting behind the robot at

he s always there
wonder why

perform just as well as men on spatial
when the
include human like
the
of this study are huge what
are we giving to our tech
do we include social
to equalize performance
i think the lead up to whether it s ai or not may be valid but the leaf there about it not being reasoning got me
a robot can still reason about where it s going to go based on a model that model
t have to be self made by itself through massive
of data that could be dangerous
i got the diagram in my
this morning you may have some
on the need to be data driven for an ai to reason that s


nice one
lovely to have you at
on
thank you for your visit


science is
for tenure track
come join us in beautiful
canada
i
t realize
was visual too cross modal
between visual auditory tactile i d be super interested in that

i
been looking at the

lately and wondering what

a video satisfying to watch
from the affective community
amazing
yep i
be there
the ideal personal robot should be more friendly soft honest trustworthy gentle nice peaceful competent happy emotional and sensitive
to a general robot thanks for


that was neat interesting result about learning preferred joke
not necessarily being more funny variety is the spice of life
apparently

is shipped with a feature

under the accessibility
that turns off social media



wow really cool talk about smell
e g another modality to send
in slack they really
it also future work

smell to orient people in

thanks the
are useful i d suggest posting them to your
page if you
t already
to
cool thanks
we are on the same
when i read this paper i
it around my lab affect induction generally is really interesting to me
agreed super sloppy writing
like it s a panel on education with a pepper
not pepper as a witness in the normal sense of understanding ugh


a cake artist that does

thanks
i
seen aged

humanoid
their
have much more play and
must be written to continue to have a neutral stance that
motor effort with respect to the aging

i d love to have the paper reference too please
can you predict the empathy a person will show team
now open for the
empathy challenge video

today
the
from the


are an interesting indication of

to teach

in this talk in


original architect of pepper and
s ai

his
audience look at your
what do they say or do that
you that they are alive
woo thanks
thanks i put it on my reading list
do you have a summary of your
and

looking to feed my reading list
the first time giving a
talk on my specific passion affective

x affect is my jam note i talk about inside out as
and gave a
to work in social constructionism
is the best i found so far certified gold standard and ranked highest quality offset by the

foundation
that
are a last resort
checked out
though generally i find offset
seem too
does
really equate to cleaning up the


from
to

thanks

thanks for the link actually i m working on a project
green food challenge to work towards this behaviour change

already on it
can anyone recommend any
carbon offset
or ways to travel less but still be a good researcher i am trying to minimize
because each trip is




and the ideal is

total per year
this semester my
engineering class will be
a food carbon cost tracker that


over an entire city by
eating
client is the city of
healthy dose of optimism balanced with action agreed is


they are lucky to have you
outreach is so important to me that i went non tenure track to make time for it
it s a
company is the coo

beau
that s true i have a feeling that comedy is a very fruitful path towards understanding in a fuller sense tars from interstellar is a great example thanks for
me of the holy grail sometimes the

are very loud

i haven t experienced that yeah there are
it

my pleasure
you re very welcome happy to help
b d m p i guess though they re too clean to be auto
someone at least
from possible


i often teach about the
room to talk about how ai
t truly understand i also tell new ai research
to strive for understanding
but if you re talking about general ai then yes i agree with you
seriously
s
auto
to i love you
awkward rejection

it s clearly not necessary i can have
with my
that are useful and there is no consciousness behind it
thanks for reading it i tried to work on the grounding problem of
it is not clear yet to me whether people really want
to feel and whether this will advance our needs in
of
but still very interesting
how to make a robot use theory of mind very interesting project
that s for sure
i have
an authentic robot
project in my

my
talk and thesis but not sure anyone
to fund it
i agree


some great work here
true both fall into the uncanny valley now i m
of the
that fall very close to the
on the chart

good point those
are freaky


check it out thanks
i
been thinking lately about the
between
and
both walk around react to
but lack consciousness and
they both have
keep

and don t really understand what s going on i guess
here is my
angelica
ca
if you come up on
we can visit the robot lab as well
great imagery to remember agree with
false

more at least in machine learning and more specifically how it s related to precision
recall i remember recall because of the
incident
recall the
that say there s no pedestrian when there is one
that s good feedback can t wait to chat more about it
great please send me an
at angelica
ca and i
keep you in the loop i will be looking for feedback to see how best to adapt the university curriculum to fit your needs thanks
super send me an
at angelica
ca and i
be in touch thanks
great would you mind sending me an e mail at angelica
ca i
connect further with you from there thanks
there may be some overlap please shoot me an
at angelica
ca and i
ensure you receive the information once it s prepared
excellent i
send you an e mail

twitter poll i m teaching
engineering to

this fall

would you want to be
for research or personal
welcome to
we just did a wine tour on the island this past long weekend i d recommend it

science
interested in an academic position here in beautiful
canada
is
for teaching faculty

in computer vision
do join us
awesome

even for people who are not just learning to code it s crazy how an example is so much more useful than extensive
documentation

on physical appearance

but i hope men understand it can be
especially on pro
sure if your
page is about make up
then it could be a compliment but otherwise just weird and out of context

to be on this list
perhaps the fact that
is a city word
around quickly is also a factor are local
like the
in silicon valley more effective


indeed saving face is really important in some not all





my first lecture for a
engineering course role

is that what you mean by your question about
meaningful vocal
by smiling in the first place
thanks for
in my one and only stint doing voice acting i was
to smile even when
documentary style educational content it really
a difference
yes for cross modal effects love this
that is so funny d totally agree we should meet up sometime

thank you for starting this awesome program we are so happy to be a part of it
there are many stem summer
but this was the first in canada for high school
to explore artificial intelligence
and machine learning
and done so happy with our first year of invent the future there is so much to learn in the field of ai and the
in this program
an amazing depth and subtlety of understanding can t wait for next year

i d like to acknowledge our program
who is running the whole show for invent the future without whom this ai summer program would not be possible


camp

to pursue
in computer science ai
we will miss you

that robot in the middle
like
if you blink fast

i like that i guess in
you mainly talk about survival of the species as the end goal homeostasis
not dying out like a
s cry
not cry probably just need those two as the end of the chain
thanks

my
on lesson on training and test
tomorrow is it just me or do these
look oddly sensual
for anyone else that
to do this i used
mute
feature in
i just want to read my research
in peace without
of sexual abuse death violence and trump i
go read my local news
once a day like a human
definitely top left quadrant
ever


also i
been interested in how
and dogs are trained with
the click is associated with food which is associated with body good and so the clicker is used as a proxy for positive reinforcement


there are many people around me is an interesting example for
people it can be
for introverted people it can be scary
i don t know to what extent this is innate or trained maybe learned through reinforcement learning from parent

i am really looking forward to your book
oh sweet i
give that a read d
i
defined some robot
that map to
but they were all ego centric battery level actuator temperature plus expressive body state that essentially
to vocal
vocal loudness
still so much to do




as the expression of human flourishing or distress as they occur in the mind and body in his book
error
this is a great read too
so yesterday i decided to refine my feed to reduce the number of depressing click bait
and suddenly my twitter is back to its original purpose
with cool
and
this is great
in this way i m totally on board with everything
down to
to stir action plus both cognition and proprioception valence
map to the same emotion almost indistinguishably
yes that s true and sometimes we misjudge the real reason we feel a certain way e g my husband is a
head but actually i m just hungry
that would be super fun what would be the input i
only done this for
but am really interested in
other
like context stimulus
the brain then

from the body to be able to process the change a ton of energy is re
to the brain so you can make new
recreate your understanding of the world so you just feel tired and like sleeping but your brain is going a mile a minute
note that the biological
involved with
are pretty useful too for instance sadness
when we have a goal something
us from
said goal and we appraise the situation and it
we can do nothing to change it

i saw this book in an independent bookstore and the title enraged me so much that i bought it at full hardback price to read it anyway
we re talking
d let s talk

when i was
at
i used company
to run a boba workshop straight milk tea the
and it was the best ever
i
sleep now waking up early to go ride a historic train out in the
happy


i like this idea of methodically visiting all
in town casually leaning over the counter and going so
what s in that syrup over there and like percentage wise
honestly it
t far from the truth for me either i was living in
at the time and decided that i might die if i had to go back to no boba land carried
of powder
of tapioca in a suitcase that eventually broke when i
back to

good times


on

i really like
really near
too
i once pretended to be a business person interested in opening a boba shop in
in order to get bulk

and fat
from a warehouse i may know some recipe
shifty



fruit tea is pretty amazing too get their basic fruit tea but out of the way
there s pearl fever and bubble world up at
too so you can try
the boba well at least like






that s silly its a mark of empathy i m married to a
man and when i m in the
it
naturally to speak like people around me it s unconscious and polite really
first introduction of popcorn into
love it


this is like
tay territory

that works too people here are friendly and are happy to help if you need
also for
or
you can just tap your credit card super easy

the short term
really are pretty lame in
you could try getting a public mobile
at


d
second time through i know murder is bad but i think the best thing for you would be to not use joint
directly
i know murder is bad but i think we said no

a now somewhat old article on how
should develop emotional intelligence through social

the robot
distress in low valence bodily
the

a negative reaction and the robot
the stimulus mental simulation body association
re

and
i gave a talk at

recently about
robot flourishing and distress based on battery level and motor heat
with these bodily
are built through


great talk re

based on function you might be interested in developmental
work e g motor babbling with
that let a robot discover the function of a tool

it
with
had a robot coffee at
why the robot arm fast to iterate with new
or
and there is still a human nearby who can now spend their time

about coffee instead of
the repetitive task
awesome

live in individualistic
and tend to express their
explicitly by contrast
live in collectivist
and tend to suppress their
to maintain harmony amongst the group




very cool paper about the
of

my take
from reading this commentary we could try to distinguish judgment from perception in ai and tie in memory as a local cache more relevant for
that have a continuous experience of the world rather than most visual recognition ai

intriguing must read


like i need a login to access
then in between
it could remember it still had work to do i guess just like me on the bus


uncompleted
that the algorithm


to complete to achieve those
so
imagine a self driving car we only feed it one goal at a time now imagine an

an
goal of drive at least
people per day
it
we are also
social
in our brain when doing nothing i just saw an article about it and i can relate

love it yes the thing to do would be always

the future there is the really low level stuff too like when looking at a handle on a cup our
motor cortex
firing
exactly
yes we both agree that multimodal
is a thing but the point here is that current
perception
only take external input they would
what this voice
based on sound only or sound visual but not sound brain
interesting usually multimodal fusion is via sensory
the phenomenon here
when one of the
is internal and not sensed in the traditional way just thought even if you think the word it

another example of how perception
our internal
priming anyone know an ai model that
this
must include priming in

that
to me that
need theory of mind to properly estimate an emotion understanding of

a probability distribution of likely
in a given situation


they should take into account more information than just a human s face
their emotion in this article she
about how the same baby cry can be
as anger fear frustration hunger depending on the situation

defined in this ted talk and in the book

are

is there a link to the workshop

very interested
what was the name of the paper author curious how compassion is defined and expressed
at i
the multimodal human robot interaction

with



of real
in the wild
for up to
min each with pepper in

paper



rodney

in
thanks for pointing it out
might be possible with
like
just would need higher fidelity
for face



about building

that work robustly the proof you can
the code and try it yourself



about
simulation for robot

promising for physical and object interaction but how can we do it for human interaction would need excellent





i might have misunderstood his point a bit he might have been mostly against mechanical turk

here s another one of his

yeah the whole thing was pretty inflammatory i think he actually did mean the former though
nope he
t suggest one but
around those
confidence
and

are

she
doing more robot learning in simulation and

that won t break easily

s

to end to end deep learning for
to convert sensor input to action
he briefly
a couple
like this
yeah he blasted the use of p

rodney

about
at d need less micro
on a
b with people who don t use
instead need invention of new ways to interact like the mouse and keyboard
happy to be here in sunny

terrible picture but i found my first robot while

this thing



is becoming an ai
with the brilliant


taking the lead of a new ai research lab the time is now to move to beautiful high tech


yeah it was a tongue in cheek suggestion out of exasperation i know some
who like those
because it can help fund a family member s part of a vacation and i can t say i haven t used it in the past when i used to fly more time to change though
so i like this idea at getting at people s
instead of
very interesting let s say you had a value about helping
or being a good citizen then some


by the government for social good should be intrinsically



yes this is ideal but governmental
and
are designed to try and make behaviour change is that bad too does
in the technology piece tip it over the edge is it
for
but not

check out this work by

very excited to see that


a distinguished professor in ai and human robot interaction will be coming to canada
to learn more about the work of the


check out the
autonomy lab
pictured here and the

lab
much of the work
can be found here kudos to the
autonomy lab

i m actually really curious now we know that prediction can influence perception do they literally hear
due to prediction and visual information to the extent that audio information is


it s totally illogical maybe i should study that priming effect fear response to possibility of speaking

down prefrontal cortex
yep we are running it here in
this summer
i am so
with these budding elementary and junior high school
in japan making pepper

might want to check out

this you might be interested in a couple
i
made with
but there s so much more to do made with my husband and video game programmer
and a more recent one
oh

calling all grade


who want to get

open until


r t
this talk
the fundamental

recognize how we feel
those

could learn from shelly the turtle
you might be interested in our paper on turn taking with

the refresh rate would be at least
i d imagine and

recently come out with higher

for the
market do we know what model was used

can t wait to get a pepper here with the new

cute
does
use
s to detect
a case of black box missing transparency if its taking this long to find out what went wrong
our model is collaboration not confrontation
great
from talk this week at
interview and identify
in
between c suite

and
to avoid accountability
is everyone on the same ethical page about the ai being built any blind

and
stickers i m all about the
stickers yes for the article can t wait

sense for
you do mention
and
in the paper companion
in general thinking

can benefit from all

i like the
one and the ability to be

also is it purposefully limited to humanoid

if you build human like humanoid
read this proposal for
can i join the club seriously i am reading it carefully half way through now really great so far initial
what s your stance on empathy your
law for not feeling pain fake empathy is apparently bad
la turkle but real empathy would that be bad too

i think i might need to break into a new research area d

to build an
system that can see hear touch and interact with people and physical
through a
system competition

but there is a long history of
not being transparent about the extent of their robot autonomy this is against the


of
agreed though that it s cool that it s off leash now
excellent engineering but was this remotely

true perhaps a better analogy would be

it s another way of thinking and communicating
and it s not about role
for you it s role

first focus on building the intelligence necessary for good
likely as

but
to keep code platform agnostic

thanks
would love to


i have a paper there but unfortunately not
we should connect somehow otherwise

it s a shame my original article was longer and more
was
for length

although there may need to be a restriction on
re nature of the operator was thinking more interaction not semantics

nope we don t need the total
test the robot can look like a robot just the interaction would be indistinguishable from a human


i also think that to get a real solution to a
will take more than deception that s just the way
are
it right now

they also need to know that a few
of cool interaction
down after a while

fair enough my thought for
was it s easily
for people that come in contact with the

great piece in on

i
be giving a talk at
tomorrow at

with a surprise at the end
that will help but the ideal tech could break down cultural
and fix the
issue no pressure
like


difficult to assemble a team so widespread in the world boston
la

need very strong integration
to cloud tech
cool contest open to


in us and canada to build an awesome
skill to educate entertain and engage
i was a scholar for canada in
it
me pay off my student
and i m still in touch with the other

i met

do apply

very interesting i m guessing the answer is
if the system will behave differently based on the emotion input
if we don t have a right to inspect interrogate decision making
it s like
secret


o

people building
don t fall prey to the
of the
we need a
oath for this

kindred is piloting new
with major

i m with on
new

in
to constrain learning
epigenetic

can we make
that progressively develop these emotional
that would be super interesting to try
oh tried to look up robot learning
and found instead for human learning
yeah
as a bonus it could teaching all the baby learning
people are trying to build
but still so much more to explore
i suggest some
that could be innate in a human robot sec


great talk i d read a synopsis but watching is much better thanks for
the link agree about trying to find what could be innate

two perfect
of course we would make them look like
movie
for our entertainment
was on public radio today had fun talking about
and k from blade runner

definitely a reasonable request need to look up

on how this could be done
it
you have my photo and name up as speaker for an event i haven t been
to
interesting request from a new client in the home i don t want the robot to nag me
what kind of
of

are you looking for
i think the issue is if you do find any
trying to fix it will be hard if you don t understand how it works
unlike a formally
system though there is no guarantee for safety
i m

advocate you can understand the system outside the box even if the box itself is black
another way to know its
is to run as many
as possible on it


top comprehensive university

back in the day people
t like the word ai was scary so they decided to use intelligent


open letter to jane kim aka

was wrong about the robot tax and so are

by
aw i wish i saw his presentation do you have any article reference for the total
test
ah i
he s talking about the

test scenario not the same for me i don t want
to look like

oh no i just
an article about this


on socially assistive
the hard part
t activity recognition it is intent and emotion recognition
ran into at who ran the undergrad
competition that
me into my career gratitude
i was on
in
a show

on

as usual talking about

thank you


excellent
wow
taking off now to attend
in
and move back home

thanks for everything

got my bag onto the airplane with almost no human intervention would you argue that this system is taking

to anyone already in

to be free ice cream in
on

soon to be joining
again yes
looking forward to working on developmental
again with great
like you two

team

this is actually interesting for
b c
with the same
could be understood differently based on appearance context

i presume here the
were shown
of a baby crying and
at an object the photo is missing context

read the book how
are made a large percentage of perception is projection based on context

we had a paper accepted at

some latest work with pepper as well it will be in the interactive session
really wish i could have been there the

amazing
for such a compelling conference
this
relevant
who s research is this fascinating
even more fodder for
s projection of emotion


cause

near the equator works better whereas closer to
can actually have a warming effect

thanks very glad to be back
thanks i think i understand better and this is why
can t be
everywhere to be effective they are dark and contribute to heat


fast growing
are a thing the issue
to be land

that said i m not yet convinced
are better than static carbon capture taking a climate science course right now still learning p
i wonder what the output of
are i do know that
take too long to grow and we can t make enough of them fast enough
i had to look up albedo why would we need everything to be shiny or you mean everything should be a solar cell
if the
product were a commodity the
could basically mine the air based on this map
if i m not mistaken there are higher
at certain
in the atmosphere
i
t seen this one thanks
i see flying
working all day long converting

them back to earth to be used
oh power

by solar i see what you mean use excess green energy to clean the air double
i like it

want to make sure it s done right
my pleasure



check out this job from



one thing i love about
is the insistence to care for one s
and work life balance
please stop
robot as a term for
about ai
robot and ai are not interchangeable

speech recognition is not language understanding it s transcription

he yes but ai


he a more accurate term would to use

instead
robot here is emotionally resonant but misleading and inaccurate

he please stop
robot as an image or term for

i don t like watching it we have to be smart and conscious about the technology we build
many of us in developmental
believe that a body is necessary for true ai see

is to feed back into psychology and
our

back stateside will require

yep
don t always mean that the person is happy glad to know that what i used to call the
smile is
a dominant smile
so my alma mater
was essentially
where the
were born
instead of worrying about future ai we could solve the runaway ai that
now



impressive
hope you hear from us shortly

of global
think it is important that ai
can understand and communicate
natural human language

thanks

is especially surprising e g people in a group

thanks for the link i m

i wonder how this is
with data like that from is it simply expression that

thanks for showing how much work it is to put together a talk cool idea to work it through via

the feedback on bossy

is interesting i
give some

that s great that code
crazy complex please tell me it s not the code from the first lesson

could be confused either way also think





effect
robot w
accent was preferred to us wonder if gender or accent

effect

i also wonder if any
have been done with genderless
perhaps we would take
just as well from a purely robot voice

do you have a study for this in japan pepper
like a
year old boy in


compliance meaning that the user does what the robot

hi pam ah wow
ne d so nice to hear from you again i always was happy you
an enthusiasm for


what was the talk on
agreed i
a
talk suggesting the same empathy for morality
as opposed to being unaware and
to be jolly
not sure about it seeming hurt but rather that it is

not
by
but i
take it glad they

the point for me is to actually think about emotion not ignore it completely when making ai

rob
was
about
causing suicide
ah he is right i was
old
for employee
the robot count is recent though
ah it was a
talk i was wondering if i was going crazy i saw
near my desk today so
not sure about how many
i only know the robot head count from a presentation i did last week


in




around the world


and pepper
but

always told us to practice our conference

times
how long was your talk

the talk so that you can do it automatically
a lot of time that s ted level
yep this is more revelatory of the general lack of understanding of how human empathy is built rather than about

oh what a cool experiment to run i wonder if any
have been done on brain activity when

what if
could learn emotion the way human
do

that this was research carried out under

good idea if there was a psych expert that could define how it s done then a robot could be a way to implement that
today i met someone who
to be a

when he was little like me any other closet


out there
as for the human contact i imagine someone like a parent someone who
t judge or give up on you
or anonymously
me in touch with a coach therapist from the comfort of my own home it s the first step to reach out
the robot would need some advanced ai indeed i wonder about a robot who could know
and ask the right

ah yes helping to understand
and
was invaluable i need to find another coach actually have any

an unfailingly loving robot support coach until the point at which i have the confidence and attitude to tackle the world
she also
and
me to mindfulness
so i guess that kind of thing i would also like in a robot
i employed a life coach when i was at my life s
point she
me and was unyieldingly positive gave advice
exactly in reply to
as a conduit a more human and physical way to bring people together
exactly
i like the idea of an alert have you seen big hero
the robot

the boy s
when he s feeling sad alone
now we avoid the phone b c we don t know if we
be
the person how about a robot that can say hey x is free
and maybe even be a way to make contact the telephone was a way to call people when we knew they were available at home
and for
i hope they can be there to encourage contact with
to break down the pessimistic
in our

i like s advice from his emotional first aid book
was very lonely in japan used the
feeling icon once but otherwise very difficult to express
therapy is treating
such as depression to become
positive psychology surpassing
to reach happiness flourishing
yeah
voice a part of it would be like
but therapy and
psych are different
yes that s right a facilitator in the home with its body it could expressive encouraging compassionate without judgment

love the idea what kind of sessions would it recommend length
i have used
which checked your mood also
designing a bar to maximize
how small high tables and loud music make
drink more
it is almost as though our brain is
to contemplate the future whenever it
itself unoccupied
it
there are positive psychology
that are broadly helpful such as daily gratitude

thank you d



i agree i think pepper should be wirelessly
other little
around the house perk of being a robot telepathy
people seem to like it when i clean
pepper and
collaboration
come learn how to program pepper at in
today i m here come say hi
super awesome
last curry
at

wow would love to hear her story
when you post about national
in engineering day and someone
when is national men in engineering day how do you reply

got access
another link
would love to hear about it is there a paper for reference


s a wonderful place to live the only thing is to choose a company with non insane working

what a little girl
when you tell her she s pretty

sure d


and
two review
on the field of developmental





part of the field of developmental

mo

a point
no way i m just going to enjoy that nice warm feeling i have right now

twitter
yes i was the first search result when he
for
university
a few
ago i met
on twitter this weekend that
beau put a ring on it


her is a very interesting film spurred a lot of good discussion the in us about
and ai
thanks
yes will be
the first
of

in


are you involved with
the
fest this
i m wondering if they re still gathering

oh this is about me d
would you want therapy from a
psychologist the atlantic how about this
for
just bought your book looking
to reading i wonder how your work might inform these
of q s
empathy and morality psychology today
emotion s role in making moral
what is personal force
intentional harm for
by
one week left till my
month sabbatical in
no traveling just
on
i
been wanting to do for a while
nice ending on robot empathy working on it

i think it will be a v different experience at home many
are not comfortable
personal
in public
what would you do if you had lots of

why will succeed where

have
maybe b c from the beginning pepper s
are designed by



love this idea
young


with wooden
by



nope not at
those
are all my

sure
t

she had her own agenda that day i bet she
t think her
would still be with me almost

later glad she was wrong
people never stop trying you can do it
a long time ago on a difficult day my first
teacher
me in the
and said angelica you can t just stop trying
the future of gaming interesting curious to know what you have in mind for the

thanks are you in

i m moving to
i have an admiration for a government that
gender parity in the government and also pain


it certainly
that way sometimes
thanks for
me why i m leaving japan female member
sexually

during assembly session
interesting maybe evil robot
stem from the idea that
would have cog empathy but not affective
yes also thought it was cool when she said science can be

not similar to logic
morality prob in

how to make hard
interesting talk about how
differ from science useful for

wait i know the answer to this i m sorry d hey maybe they could put a toque on it if you know what that is

d
yep brisket is one of those
where you eat it and you re like i can die happy now

yeah it s kind of creepy like a scarecrow
i wonder if goes to the

beer
have fun
yeah d
why only one positive universal facial emotion maybe b c relief triumph love
are better expressed w voice
wow amazing love it yes looking forward to joining you
soon
hey
that panda s so cute where was it
hope this
a smile to you even if for the
moment
this was a great article the point about

making human
exhausted was eye opening
sure
and i move from
to
in august we can all commiserate in our mass exodus
two of the lady
on the project


is a
group company so we
still have some
influence and
from time to time i presume
you mean with
jean yeah
i was just informed that canada s governor general is now

term length at her majesty s pleasure
just
that even though i
be leaving japan for
i
still connected within a
group company that
me happy
thanks for

i

my preprint before but i do it once more to celebrate its official publication it was more than a year in the making

voice to recognize gait emotion dynamics in voice
gait are similar enough to perform cross modal recognition
the
robot towards

to develop multimodal emotional intelligence my work just pub d
that is great food for thought
science
knowledge that s objective and rational but the process to get there is subjective and emotional
pepper
in front of a mirror hi i m pepper er that s no good
to meet you i m pepper

secret tropical hideaway in
village i guess it s not a secret







pour








movie is free all this month to watch
d
i think something should happen if you touch the back of his hand or head
did you see what
when you touch his hand
is still my go to music source for happy fun code time still i miss you
talking about how the os will be generic for all
of
pretty sure it s based off

definitely
v
i guess
i think the
of



people to pronounce it just fine though i m not sure how v becomes b u

s vision is not to make a robot but a robot os it s
v
pronounced
for motor control
that s a really interesting question because i think the answer is no
the only one there but it s not social
it
a one
hand so it can hold
similar to
i m not sure it can pick
off the floor
environmental effects on development are not just noise interfering w an organism s
nature they re integral
thank you
thanks for
on this in
this is wild
what d

can t wait to hear more

i admit i still want a house cleaning robot have pepper telepathically command flying drone scrubber brushes job done
humanoid robot

to be a comedian the facial
help i find via

where is this

the tunnel problem for autonomous
via


son s vision of emotional

back to

cool might want to check out my
talk on trust
and emotion





new

for product launch via

you re my hero i wrote the
page on kismet based on your book welcome to twitter mother of

wow what are you
wow this is the year for
with heart
today i received my work permit for


here i come

s business style is one to be
pepper based on

biz
way of
dev time
ha awesome



thanks dynamics in emotion is my general research theme
i wrote a post about this
on the
of
see the anew
too
text
or music

beginning of
s up in

we were in
w o any

that
awesome
thanks did you find it useful
it should be noted that it was pouring rain and a business day i suppose we
see if more
visit this weekend

i don t really get the question d
us coverage on pepper good idea at

you can appear on the tablet to say hi to

it s at

and




is an amazing person he used to be an engineer designing


won top
in

where son
a successor
it s
but went to see pepper

in the shop today
was

san the project lead
yes in
we often
to the robot as a she
same as
why anyone would want a pipette hyper realistic
are a research tool not a consumer product
maybe indirectly my research at
will be on ai
and

like son san is quite eager on the topic
the rap
me too p
yes finally i can tell you the secret i
been keeping i worked at
at
that s why i knew that
place
thank you i can t take the credit for the robot dance though it was made by
s talented animator
agreed i still keep calling pepper a she
is pepper a boy or a girl

you can go test out its
and dialogue system i hope it won t be too noisy
i trained the
partner how to use the robot made demos and early
so
of what they
done with it
as the


i used your
so much to help ease the intercultural collaboration thank you


you see what you are
to see
for a long time we
t
to take
of the robot finally
as for my part in the pepper project i was involved in the initial


technology to japan as
manager
son just like a little

t necessarily know what love is in the beginning pepper will grow and learn from its environment
pepper is the result of
and
s
year long partnership based on
s technology from beforehand


that there are

so the robot will work tho less well even if disconnected with the cloud

there will be a developer conference in
and you can come try out the robot at the atelier
son
the basic expression of emotion is universal but yes localization at country and household level will be important
what s the plan overseas each country
different
customs
for emotion
you re welcome
what about
the robot they aim for is different
for efficiency prob higher cost we aim for a fun robot that we can enjoy
why pepper the code name was taro for a long time but this robot will be
d
so we chose pepper instead of a

name
son
that as a child when he saw the atom boy robot animation he felt sorry that he did not have a heart


can be
between
and pepper with very little




stake in
and
the infrastructure for cloud service
son
pepper s base price and maintenance to
a pet which

for food

q
a at the

every

the robot will do a show in between
can freely interact and talk with pepper
q
a pepper
t
it used speech recognition and understood us
q
a pepper s battery life is

the tablet on the chest is replaceable
a game with the
family pepper can become different

pepper in
robot audition



the stage they produced the
and they will now produce pepper




sound
to make
for pepper
will open in
and

pepper will go on sale in

price




vision is to make an affectionate robot one that can understand people s
when a family member is happy so is the robot
pepper let me introduce
who brought me to life
pepper s other
sound direction distance measurement face emotion recognition
pepper s function
i m good at waving body

pepper is not good under pressure

and

pepper robot unveiled a robot with heart

want to watch this

done one step closer to
amazing times we live in also will be taking a screen break for a few days
i
be living in

cool thanks
hello

in tech the missing
by
yes you can do it
my next talk with
will be on may
at the pink cow in

a little whisker of happiness on this grey
day
how s this i made a robot cry and its
made silly
at it

at first i read how to quit your life and robot p i need a vacation

my paper is basically about
a i
and
but also
on how we generalize between

the
robot towards

to develop multimodal emotional intelligence
been
in


review done now to tackle
more
but all i want to do is make a video for the
video competition
oh i just saw this very interesting
nothing could go wrong the
only
right

artificial intelligence

developmental science


deadline extended to may

b d m p it was delicious
i just did this

interesting
grid for dealing with
in this
talk by



your talk great idea to teach
by re


to become


sure what s up


what do you think about this portrayal of robot
excluding the last last scene
what level
in japan this was
in bachelor
yr
master s
d s present in front of lab or at a full conference
your talk was great very useful
thanks

ted
by
in computer science

and this punishment
more when y is from a different group than x
thanks so x will punish awesome person y for doing good stuff
x is not doing good stuff themselves and


interesting in that case i wonder what the social
that make people un naturally nice are

is your talk

why do people use digital communication to say cruel
they would never say in person why is there no empathy how can we fix it
you are one of the

most bad ass ladies i have ever known i am so sorry that this

to you c
thanks
t know about

they re surprisingly difficult to find only

so far with computer scientist
thanks yes i
both her
d
ah i love
s talk i thought her background was engineering but it
like it was in

thanks
ha i made a got comparison just now too
how important is a i to
i guess without it
are like

does anyone know of any
a female computer scientist
i just
the
it
like it s mostly
towards

b c of room size limit
science is an effort to understand how the natural world works with observable physical evidence as a basis
cool good luck and let me know when it s out i d like to write about it
wow will it be shown in public soon d
in
this time
at
this
i
be
about
emotion and what that
to do with music
this
cat face and
post
for
on a rainy day



wow indeed
most times it s quite interesting sometimes i miss that sense of belonging to a group though
i m a




in japan this on identity
up how i feel
sad or angry cultural
in emotional body
in a talk by


sorry limit of tweet length


to confirm whether the production could be replicated

po for starting this group hope i can join my

it s my
culture tho i m
l
my pleasure i mean
i m happy to see that the

picked up on san s technology and added new
and expert opinion

i watched it on the
course human emotion

culture and emotion super interesting

welcome
now i m working on
within those personality
let s see if it works d

love it i m not jealous i m just slightly abnormally happy d
the
for the jealous clip not sure if it
sense only in context though
some
high
jealousy hate mixed with love with some
like a
throat
cool i
it mainly to get bite sized clips to sprinkle into the robot behavior i wonder if

would work
robot code of ethics via
oh cool i met laurel a few
ago in
small world d
thanks
the petite geek can music convey a personality thanks


right with luck the typical acceptance rejection period will go much faster because of it


wow

of course glad it was accepted just want to point out that when
complain about pay
it s really a choice
it s taken more than a year to have my paper
maybe it s worth it how do you decide to make your paper open or not
thank you for your contribution to the journal if you would like to make it open access please pay us


no
the fact that
must still be tele

the gap opportunity in robot intelligence

no
on it yet but take a look at the proportion of

agree mistrust is the prob w
there can be no suspension of disbelief even

not sure if we know there s always the poss that they feel what they show and we can delude ourselves b c that poss

thanks for posting
oh ho
does anyone there think a robot could actually love thereby making the deception point moot
the symposia look so cool will keep an eye out for their next

nice idea feedback in any form i bet is better than nothing at all but i m not a psychologist i just

on the other hand i wonder if excitement is a more

oh wow

and d
but you re right i was thinking that

no facial
but they do bare their teeth squint their

i d certainly have more research to try out if it did d in the
a very emotive voice would help a lot
la c

tho i m not sure
have awareness of everything what about private

encapsulation

don t get access
i like the idea about consciousness being defined succinctly as attention learning
are born conscious always learning
your talk was super interesting i went on to read a bunch of your



the
on robot
to


same thing with

expression through movement though last time i watched
i fell asleep p
at
i saw


banter dance exclaim on stage lots of
but static
so
don t need


honda and
my
worked for them for

of her
year
career they re

how important is physical contact with your infant interesting
on emotional development from a young age
this sound tube is oddly satisfying

of disorganization in the
of
with autism anyone know if laminar development
at birth
can
fall in love and why would they
this is my field
that learn like
it s not yet clear if they need the same hardware tho
my personal view is that the
not the
is the interesting part we
learn about ourselves by trying to make them
finally


we don t need to make
be exactly like
b c we already know how to make those

also
the q in his book when we replace body
with tech we will find the essence of humanity
that s a great q i think this research
more on the side of
becoming



thanks will watch right now
i like
s child machine approach personally
ai
thanks for the links i
t
about
tho i knew of
company bought by
yes a few
push it




i totally agree for this reason very few are
general ai now and
is

agreed i m very much for
ai as a way to improve our scientific knowledge
of the mind rather than ai for engineering
also i have no problem with specialized ai as i said it can be useful i m just not as interested in it personally
what if we need to make a huge leap instead of incremental
really few
focus on it we need parallel

specialized ai is useful the problem is generalization to new
which
are capable of but current ai is poor at
an
approach where information is linked together in a meaningful way could lead to conscious ai
to

s theory

of last tweet if we continue to make ai
as we do now disparate specialized
we will not make conscious ai
consciousness is information integration individual brain
too isolated from one another
low consciousness
wow nice


sad when an article i wrote
ago
scooped
i
when i read my
up close early in the morning my
stay crossed for
afterward are they
wrong
when you wake up in the morning do you stretch or roll around your neck and
i wonder if this is calibration like
need
my
part about this research is if the robot is injured one of the
is cut it can re babble

to function

now it s official
thanks
yeah i could wander around the city in it it was fun


thanks







thanks
it was so nice
them there

yes i can see that like what does perhaps on top of
it
me of the
musical expressivity contest
and the ai could be
or not a big challenge is if a
min talk is
w enough expression to not fall asleep
given a topic it would prepare a speech in front of a live audience and
standing
would decide the winner
i guess they took it down either it s a
or false the concept was
min for an ai to come up with a ted talk
the ted x prize is interesting because
usually share their own personal story to connect an ai
t have a history to share
you re very welcome
