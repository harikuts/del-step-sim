# DEL-Step: An Interactive Decentralized Learning Simulator

A simple, easy-to-deploy, interactive, step-by-step simulator for decentralized learning, using Tensorflow. PyTorch integration planned for the future.

*Currently a work in progress.*

## Overview

DEL-Step is a Python-based step-by-step simulator meant to be used as a playground for decentralized learning with Tensorflow, the most widely used machine learning platform.
