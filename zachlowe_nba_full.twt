of the

so far with

say
as part of his trade to new
the
have
steven
to a
year
extension
tell and i


the
disinterest in
was puzzling like the
taking a flier
can shoot
off movement and he
fast off the ball

post

and
of the

so far with the la
loading up
s
what the
actually did
hayward leaving boston phoenix rising
s sneaky good weekend much more
original
story from the wee
here
my old
teammate
in the
on the story we broke at
this morning about

visiting with pope

delegation
kyle
sterling brown and

the national basketball
association executive director meeting is ongoing at the

breaking a delegation of

and union
are currently at the
meeting with the pope who last week
them to discuss their advocacy on social justice

this re
and
is a big deal
have generally tried to operate under the principle of if we agree to the
rookie
extension it
to be an ironclad
year deal
and
successfully fought for player
in year
it


this subject line made me laugh
we

the let s get weird stage of the

this is a veteran s minimum deal
say absolutely worth a flier i
long had my eye on
as an under the radar guy who could develop into a rotation player for a good team

jordan

hayward late last night in an effort to close the deal for
hayward

today hayward obviously
how
and

him to an offer sheet in restricted free agency in



to clear a decent chunk of salary to fit this deal into cap space could in theory execute a sign and trade as well


as a team to watch on the jump and with this week did not necessarily expect the to get this high


made my all defense ballot one of the great unseen
of last season was
absolutely
point

and even some

point shooting fell further but
hit career best
at the rim worth a look for the
for sure
oh did you just drop the carry on on perk s head that s not going to end well for you

biannual exception heat out here doing heat

robin what is your take on g wiz

holiday is re
with the

on a three year deal worth just over

tell

i almost wonder if they made snell
trade for this reason snell s

deal
this season



this season

next meaning
can stretch the total of

over

as opposed to being able to stretch snell over



have now
for clint



and
as had been


they

a fair bit at
last season a lot of other
are wondering what this all
for
collins
come
out
i think that s a no for me
plus an ode to



post
and join to recap the
draft and look ahead to free agency analysis
that did and
t happen on draft night much more
apple

apple
unless something
is at play
would fit into the

trade exception with
likely sending yet another draft pick to the thunder

post
an ode to

and then and i recap the

draft the
that did and
t happen the
at the top much more
what can you say absolutely awful
is a beloved player a star and a great teammate hope he comes back strong
curry is on a great contract three more
about

per
can hit free agency after this coming season

some
wing defense and another good
round pick coming up here j rich is better than he
last season phi
elite shooting

and
are close on a deal that would send josh
and the no
pick to
for seth curry
say
this pick will be lottery
in
source

this is almost a challenge trade between the
and
with the
in between
effectively choosing
over

apple

post
on

going to game
what s at stake for both what to watch for and a preview of the eastern conference

roster
turned over completely but think of all the brutal

clips have
mostly in this round beginning w the blake
era game

pretty weighty on a franchise level today though was about
they
the game and never
back
the
only know how to play one kind of series rollicking absolutely
rollicking
special season or whatever this
been for
really likable team that
a fun style and put up a pretty legit title defense after losing a
and tonight was a
performance from


heat lounging in the bubble watching these two
kill each other
smart is incredible

cannot shake

that
foul on smart is the spider man pointing
everyone






in an absolute grind of a game where everything is hard
the defense in this series
been so so consistently good two rock solid super smart
who rarely make even little

i enjoy
s continued refusal to run clock when ahead in the final
of
and

are available
how can you not enjoy the


touched it with two
only the goalie can do that in water polo verdict no
also did a
on
with and on tonight s

game

i think both these
are true house is more important to the
than some non

might acknowledge he s solid but less important than some

might portray him as now that the series
gone off the
for the

excerpt from my
series piece on harden s record in big
as a
full piece here

post
heat a
on
s stunning reinvention w some great riley



us inside in the bubble w help from
apple
with all

series potentially one game from ending we decided to do

well
this week
i like don t like starring
rondo

on the move predatory
the art of the non screen much more
this is somehow
harden s

game as a rocket with a
of
shooting line
were elimination game
in


and


took a deep dive into harden s record in big
as a rocket before this series
i thought this was a coin flip series i appear to have been very very wrong really great work from the
disappointing effort on d from the
tonight

post
heat a
on the heat s remarkable turnaround plus some cool inside
then


us inside in the bubble w help from
apple
dan
great
from watching the heat try to reinvent themselves post


about the heat s post game
in
his journey how the heat decided who would guard
much more plus dan and i make a vow in the event the heat win it all

post
heat a
on the heat s remarkable reinvention and what this team
to
plus inside
about pat riley then


us inside in the bubble w the help of
defend one pass how the
have tried to throw off
harden and
s offense plus how both
can adjust going into tonight s pivotal game

what an absolutely ridiculous game we

all these
for
boston let s go


i m exhausted
some
in here on why i thought the
defensive
on harden worked in game

and ad were great rotating and maybe some ways to spice up la s sometimes
half court offense
ahead of game
tonight
post
and on all



apple
den
a couple of open
late but that was a monstrous
defensive effort from the
this
team is really tough


when they
dead went toe to toe with lac from the tip tonight knowing they would get peak lac effort resilient team
water polo pass alert

post
on all


with and this
a chance to be a really interesting series
apple

post
all


with and who should be favored what to do about

s burden
offense trapping harden p j tucker
various
in
for a loose ball much more
i m behind in the game just
there and wrote
water polo pass in my
so yeah
i would not want to compete against p j tucker in anything least of all for a rebound

post
ahead of tonight s
i react in real time to the
nash news the
at


we could see for both
and mil a righteous ka
rant more
apple
there is an undeniable hole in
harden s
career something beyond the missing championship which
to a lot of star
this series against the
is another chance a big one to fill it
this is
harden s chance
i only know it because i
it up so many times

post
and i react in real time to the
nash news the heat pushing the
into

an ode to silly game

gone wild more
apple
the most important thing i
learned from this post season so far is that is absolutely must follow
warning i m a little punchy because i m
weird
sleeping like at all and i may have
a new book idea for based on game
last night six

to me about
for this story in


win
win
this can only end with
banking in a
at the buzzer

advance to face the
this is my ruling thank you
i declare no one
and everyone should go home and think about what they have done
put that last

on a reel in

what is everybody doing right now in this game
look harden is just
over why no one
produced

license
he can t focus on the game
heat being able to switch


man game was big in
you could see mil trying to slip
to beat
but
kept up
to be a game within the game the whole series look for more
or hill

both ways i love ga as screener
wait how did i not get one
did that happen the game is over the series is over did i just hallucinate that

i e if

the

protection this season unprotected next season becomes a lottery pick
lottery
will be as and i
on the
post
yesterday via
official release
said
below

re both
on the pod with today we will learn soon maybe today on the lottery question but my educated guess would be that no the league will not allow the wiz to leap over cha and chi in lottery odds by going

wiz not thinking that way anyway

team return to play plan play
lottery

post

to be clear my prior tweet wondering what
if mem


and another team
whoever


was in reference to who
the advantage of no
for
of the play in

below would assume mem obviously but it s a big advantage
of course entering the final
regular season
with a

cushion

a big edge in
the no
seed anyway
have limited time to make up that gap though strength of schedule will be interesting to see
mem






sac




it s impossible for mem to tie exactly w anyone in real contention for no
what
if mem


and



does mem get benefit of no
by virtue of
and winning
more game

my first job in journalism at age

to help your team win the basketball

seriously this is very civilized
do they know

is already on the team
column on
s big day and the ripple effect of

teaming up with the

biggest question to me is how dependent phi was on butler s shot creation
deep in the
and what they do without that
flying all around

more playmaking
will improve

is really good but have to see how it

step back and digest all this but that is a monstrously huge potential starting five

that the salary cap will be at

million higher than most recent projection per league

you are handling
free agency better than anyone

about
s fit in boston and what his leaving would say about the
at the start of last night s free agency round up
the stretch
market was already thin

sense given they could not come to agreement on a longer deal with

everything

post
on the

trade boston s season from hell looking ahead to free agency and potential draft day
more
one of my favorite buy low
on the market

one huge hole in his game but he can do a lot of dynamic stuff can legit switch across almost every position worth a look on the right team

post
and i on the ad
trade what s next for la and new
boston s year from hell free agency
much more

probably
the ultra literal explanation of a sign that was self explanatory
enjoy the parade

great stuff from on
s weird

on the

trade perhaps the most important trade of an
veteran since the
acquired
in

interesting detail re

in s write up of the
trade
obviously now we have to see what comes next what does new
get for no
if they indeed trade it and who can the
get in free agency to join
and ad giddy up

getting no

the ad trade landscape even so i said on many
before the deadline biggest probably being the
special w
that the
offer as
then was fair and real and not the joke many were making it out to be

you really did it please explain to the people what i am doing
i m at a family thing wishful
thinking but initial reaction is that there is almost no chance this is a bad deal for
given the circumstance and market for ad a good haul and some chance it
better if
falter in long term unlikely w ad but still
boom

coming so close to the title and losing
would wobble some


t
much during this

vulnerability with a certain calm inside that moment in

eight frozen
from game
plus some
on the
devastation that will always define this series and what those
tell us about game

i
to cook about this after the game should have a bit about it in a column soon he was worried i was going to blow his cover
holding out hope for better news tomorrow somehow
we were a little
when we
this after the buzzer and were only learning in real time about the potential severity of the
injury


i mean if they hold onto this that is an all time run of
by
there pantheon stuff
incredible stuff from

post
appearance later this afternoon

and
taking

early
in the shot clock stood out on re watch today
wait so he was right

i cannot properly articulate how excited was about this after the game i
two

when they had last run it and they
t remember had been a while

inside the mind of
green as we break down film together green
like the guy in these clips last night a big reason this series is now tied
how

up on
is going to be hugely important
help defense is so much more formidable with both
now on
and
off the ball
oh hey the

if you re seeking an analysis of game
and a look ahead to game
just

away dig into the
post
w
most of the

i picked to go through w
were defensive
good defense can be a little harder to see but the last two are

and play no
was the one i was most excited to talk to him about
inside the mind of
green i picked

from this post season run watched them with
and had him detail what he
and
on the court


been great moving w o the ball all postseason tor made a point of

slink around the dunker spot
green had the corner to corner cut working
will be ready for that tonight but tor
that all
on pod w
when i said on the
post
with that
left some easy
on the table this is one i had in mind tor was really well prepared to move w o the ball behind

full
post
archive
any

a perhaps
part of the


green along with
was also
their
experience on defense which is really handy now they have a ton of reps together

with and without durant and
in general dating to those
series
almost
weird not to be watching

video to prep for the
also between



all
one of two regular season
and
we re almost getting a brand new

two massive
for

master class in showing how some smart and well timed off ball movement can really fool

for
and for marc
to see the
in his
season
the
trade was the right move at the time and it was obvious for a bunch of
even if some
and
would not have made it the question was always what sort of case the
could make to keep him they have done all they can

let s go

to the
they had a great season they
up tonight and made
earn that

t always pretty but man that was an intense series
to the
get your
ready the
are going to canada
yeah this is why i am
these
mil
a little too shook during the end of game
and after really curious if they can gather themselves tonight my gut
tor
mostly for this reason but my gut
been off this series

mil can adjust some a little less predictability in the half court offense more judicious in switching not switching on d extend their best
a little longer but a lot of winning a game like this is really believing you can some
who lose
straight don t does mil
interested to see how mil
tonight
have rattled them confused them outplayed them the last

tor should win at home but a
win team should have the confidence to recover from a loss that
to shock them and give themselves a chance on the road

any recent
and need something to listen to for your memorial day weekend
here s the full
post archive with a bunch of recent
thanks as always to everyone who
enjoy the weekend and a huge game tomorrow
i mean the

in their last
without
with
is getting really interesting even if it
a lot of scattered regular season
plus these last

several very smart people around the league said a version of this to me when i was polling
on how good the
would be next season if
leaves

been a consistent monster in the post season
his regular season level is
the best player in the
is a very popular question around the league right now
how the

back into their
and

what it
going forward and some perspective from recent
on what it
like to defend them at full throttle
first three game losing streak of the season for the
what a turnaround by
a home game to make the
wow
as
been the case all series
cannot score against
s set half court defense
with this announcement coming today reminder and i revealed our all
all defense all rookie
on the
post last month

what is the proper punishment for this person when caught mandatory
on the downtown
every day from

for at least
continuous
once a day every august in perpetuity as
come and go
you know why we

a lot because i picked mil to win this series and game

a ton about all season and was high on before i hope you both can recover form this

the only game in town right now for the

there shall be talk of this on a

and a look at how the
might make
s life a little easier on offense
get ready for tonight s
game

w on

how both
can make life easier on their
on offense golden state without durant the

across the
yesterday
s season more
the comment about the cut here is on point these inside out
under pressure always look easier when you freeze it that is a tricky angle how much speed is dame going to get on it and

rotating toward
just after this freeze frame

s offensive
against
was a problem all series

the entire second half with a

lead is pretty crazy great season for the
no reason to
their
at all

curry doing the harden shuffle when all he
was the open
was kind of hilarious

post

more than usual and i look ahead to

game
talk
without durant
s season the

all over the
today
s epic
much more
if you are not watching magic on first take rectify that now
in important non basketball news this is currently sailing down the east river for some reason
sensational game incredible intensity and defense by both


i m drained
said on

w that it almost
like they
some sustained time w o
not just random rest
and one game here and there to rediscover the rhythm and speed of
w o him how fast and hard they need to cut slip


i mean if you want to give it some more time to marinate

that was an absolute masterpiece from
green
looney s pursuit and help defense around the rim
been sensational

s half court d
been great transition
a couple of silly outlet pass hit ahead
and
end to end
are the only
hurting them so far also all these
i m still somehow
when the
turbo coast to coast works
for

analysis ahead of game
last

of yesterday s
post
w is on how
went up

their crazy record without
how


s
case and more first half on lottery ad

interestingly the second spectrum data
a much closer shot quality between the two
than that in
which also
me
once all the

funnel in we are going to see huge drop off in portion of tor
coming at the rim corresponding rise in mid range
a lot of well

for tor s best
and more open
for their other


shot quality
and where the
are getting their
as
to where they got them until the last two
tell a very different story
great defensive performance by the
doing exactly what they hoped to do to tor offense classic
game like the work
and
are doing keeping
going off the dribble

great
was also
not super encouraging to watch tor s offense devolve into

from the top of the arc not going to get much more than
long
out of that
half of
s
in first half came from the mid range per
be one of their highest
of the half mil
getting to the rim impossible but tor
to find a way to generate

like every
is leading to a long

for the evening commute
post
and i on lottery

genius defense

rinse repeat they do it in style though
i feel like i
seen that game like
times over the last whatever

plus


with
on bench in
though only

if you exclude
series still pretty remarkable how well mil
done in those
so far they have been a supernova with
on the floor

per
for




tor
if this

s response in game
is
be really interesting this felt like game they had to get


really good helping on
and rotating back out to
in synch rotating toward and away from the right people it s clear they are going to force
especially to prove he can hurt them from deep
at the other end of the
spectrum will we get the
versus

we want if not who
each one and what that
for the eastern conference

tales from inside the lottery drawing room plus other
from the lottery draft combine general

in

the lottery is not about luck ben it is about winning the favor of the lottery

may not be we shall see

but just as how much more than normal will
have to defend

situation

turner had three
and one made free throw the entire
combined before this game
holy god

what a response from

to hurt


in my look at this series today if we might see more of the


on both
and why i
that potential development better overall for
will be interesting to see how that
in
half
monster half for the
flying around on defense arms everywhere all
of well timed
and

struggling in the restricted area again some bad
but also some great
defense
on a half dozen or so
and after dead


to demand request to guard both
and
when

other
he d normally guard were on the floor it was very strange and it definitely did not work best guess he just
an audible
my job is over when the whole thing is won

to
how the

from game
to push boston to the brink of a potentially calamitous

in

that
pretty good

is plus
in

with p j tucker at center against the
that very small




of its own
which is comical
have been awful boxing out tucker




and os potential
and random
to flat out love the wild

series as it
tonight for a pivotal game

from overnight in boston
pounced on the

post

right after


and i gather at
s house to go over
s epic season saver




transparency
s post season legacy more
we were not drinking sadly

night
post
and i gather at
s house right after

to talk about that game boston



stuff more
three of the four conference
are being
at a pace
than any team
this season exception is mil

what
oh
update from boston i woke up a long time ago and
watching

from opening tip i am still watching

this
been my update from boston
we have
that moment
with two of the premier free
this summer are down

and facing potentially
game

random
that may or may not be important marc
elbow


per game in


per game in
during regular season

per game in

thinking you


i get the sentiment but he
more
than
or
last night and

than butler zero
is problematic but that s what

would be


push and play make in transition defend like hell find random

in half court

that

this
usage rate is down from

of phi
in the regular season to

in the
for this group to work at least in the near future he might have to become their his version of
green in a way
it s a little thing on a team with
of star power but


provided a consistent boost for
on both
in the
sneaky offensive rebounder considering how thin they are huge development for them after
blah
regular season


like a team
a coherent identity tonight fast huge good mix of how they

butler
and more pick and roll on offense considering

probably this group s best win
the

have
permission to interview
assistant

for their head coaching job league
say
nice
moving story here wishing a healthy speedy recovery to
for analysis of every series
post
w on

and

plus his new book
and
post
w
van gundy on



much more
how the
debate in

is rooted in ideological
and not quite in the way you might expect plus a fun


cameo

post

van gundy in studio on



the
of coaching in the post season
from the
glory days the current state of the
game more

man they are lucky to have you

post

van gundy in studio on



the
of
coaching
from the
glory days more
oh my god
i think it s foul trouble the
thing the fact that

of clips series were probably his best
though
and
were also good and that people overlook the impact he
running
even if he
no counting
on some of those
that lead to

it s really strange i checked his today thinking man

t been that good this
and it s like sure but also


on


shooting so

if you re curious to learn about

s rise to
post season destroyer i
him
this season from crying at
to
fire
here s a link to s book which is very good and fun and also
fantastic



post
with on his new book
analysis of all four conference
and
for
the post up game
and i honestly don t think he s
badly really his switch out and denial on
and

been good like

of the time though any mistake is obviously lethal



green is the best
on
defender i
ever seen absolutely uncanny how he

into throwing lob
only he s already moving back to tip the lob away while the passer is still
his pass
would enjoy a normal

game of the
basketball if such a thing



had a few
this q where
ended up on morris after a mil miss and
on
and i remain
by that set up something mil might want to look at doing a little more when it s




with

half
mil switching a ton leaving
here there boston
t really
but mostly doing it well and got the ball
a little more in last


there not holding back in
but boston right there also

for mil
admitted
in a suit and i
about
s need to make
tonight i may have
this the biggest game of bud s head coaching career here we go
starting

post
on his new book
how to bring back post up play



tonight s
more
sorry first four

hey if you come to boston this weekend are you going to wear a
jersey
to be clear the league
the
for the first two
of each series before said series

den
is
be fun
s pick and pop
will be something of a bellwether den already got a
corner
on


when

and
rotated off
to challenge

classic jimmy game super physical a little ugly made enough open
did well running point late
i m tired from watching that game that
driving score with

left was an absolutely incredible play under the

were

really nice first half
for


adjustment of
their
on

worked so far but tor
some
for sure also don t think tor


enough fun second half coming up


in boston and looking like himself would obviously be huge he might be mil s best driver against close
and a


shooter this season
as we told the
we do not agree with their methodology a league spokesman
and i our report
the math behind
s
of losing

to
in game


with



s audit of last season s game
against golden state and the memo they intended to send the league with it
this is an interesting take i think i like it
i
t
switching

hit a
with like

left in the game on a


when
was on
and
was further back then even
had been i don t get the point of

on
if you are just going to defend the same style he s
use that

hit a
with like

left in the game on a


when
was on
and
was further back then even
had been i don t get the point of

on
if you are just going to defend the same style he s
use that
last point here is key phi over the last month or so have tried to move
a little further toward the corner out of the dunker spot and have him set
away from the ball
largely and wisely
to ignore those
in game
to focus on the ball
they should in
wrote in my preview that i think
is going to have to defend
more in this series than he typically
against boston maybe a lot more
i get the reasoning here morris can either guard
or take
here and there so

t have to do it every possession plus hayward
to handle more off the bench still thought the switch would be hayward for


my preview of


and os key
possible
and a prediction

is an ironman if he
t play you know it s bad also might be
s best defensive option at this point against both harden and

i m still in shock at the

the end of that game one of the most bizarre
i can remember

t hear every coach and teammate yelling at him but none of the other four
on the floor tried to run up and foul

is
good at the be a large human and get vaguely in the way defense around the basket

always
to do the stuff
needs when they need it
league should dock the
one point for blowing those passing
with an
and a pass
out of

wait wait wait wait wait the
won game


both low and high honestly
this was first round in
go back and watch his performance in game
an
loss for the
he did everything on both
multiple basket steal basket
in crunch time it was crazy
in
for instance before the
thing



on




shooting and peak i
be taking the ball from you now thanks for
in this interaction defense an absolute post season destroyer
might have gotten a little forgotten after
stepped on his foot in


in
and then last year s thing but

consistently been a monster in the
it s hard to maintain
of production efficiency against the best


even better

are shooting


on
and have

i m no analytic but that
good
this is an awesome game not sure if that
was the best q of
s career but there can t have been that many better
with sensational
again
the inflatable raptor making it into game of
is an all timer and jake puddle
green

that entire series

and
of the first round so far

and o
have been great tonight keeping
in this o
all series really
more up and down for the series but very aggressive last two


post
and i chat dame s shot
s resurgence the
for
east
phoenix firing yet another coach and more

post
and i talk dame s shot
s resiliency the
for
the east semis phoenix firing another coach more


literally
t move for like an hour plus after the dame shot

is a joy and super sharp on the
broadcast
this is the first round went to
magic in
got back to hotel and watched

from tip till garbage time now watching
thunder live b c i m not going to be able to sleep anyway so what the hell


is a bad bad bad bad bad bad
man
time to put
on some sort of charge management program
also we will have an
post
tomorrow from
we are both here recall that
wrote that big
feature recently so yeah that
come up
have been watching a lot of

film the last couple of days sorry

with an eye on writing a preview later this week
a chance to be a really fun series there is an interesting case for boston starting hayward over
more to come
obvious future
star right here

help and recover
since game
have been scary good
with a few of those where exactly did he come from defense
that remind of peak

whoa
our with an update on what was one of my six most intriguing
for the season back in
how do
turner and

look on the floor together
is extension eligible after the season
last with the ball

a fracas
harden column goes into a specific alignment
is
more to combat the
force him right stay at the rim defense which is really just a variant of the scheme san
used in

how
harden is

any way he
and how he built out his game after his
humiliation the

series to reach this point plus how

tried and
to adjust
read the tweet


post
and i dig into two of the series that resume tonight

thunder
plus how harden is

more
chatter
see about that
derrick white very nearly
a perfect basketball game
not a shocker obviously but



into his

million deal for next season player option with

say

post
in studio to hop around thunder

s nightmare series so far dame harden

and why dan is still worried about boston


t exactly coaching this
like they are in a high

series at this point
yeah i just can t take the
as evidence half court d is working even last night
s half court
on
which clearly
a different methodology than
was no
of

in action and no
overall for
also this is barely



thanks interesting the
which perhaps
t as sophisticated distinguishing every transition chance paint a pretty healthy picture of
s offense regardless of after make miss to even just last night
where are you seeing these
on
i m seeing very different
based on situation
also cool to see boston
with the
that
their season before
got wacky
brown
hayward al will be interesting to see if that group turns into what everyone thought it could be
absolute crusher for the
thought

a little too long to milk the
wing


but they got enough out of it late the bogie
battle on
when indy had the ball in crunch time was fun
is good
this is such bummer after an all
caliber season for blake


t win that game without malik
big
before

went
overall still an impressive two game performance by san
heading home where they were

den will have to play well to get a split good series brewing


mother in law
fan in
as game

they must win today she may have
to storm the court if they do not
quickie

key
more
update i was already
for this tweet in person on get up this morning and i deserve it fully give me all the crow what a win by lac more to come on a
today
this is about the inevitability of the respective

series nothing more

are
hard and
well and there s just nothing they can do can we set up a couple of


for late this week
dame had to work for those


s defense was outstanding particularly
walling off the pick and roll

was everywhere on defense
did a good job getting through the off ball
for
indy
the few open
they got in the
half but they
t get many crazy good d


with the
hole is nice

data via

running zero

pick and
w
as ball handler in game
was most effective
alignment in the league this season not sure how you get to
and fail to stumble into even one
also world meet derrick white he s really good

need to post
even more in more varied ways every post is an automatic double that
to a wide open
they will fall eventually
incredible
from the supporting
last night

well enough to win just
t make any open
against a team that made a lot of

perhaps basketball

them for late season tomfoolery and or not wearing rainbow


from last week the ballad of
and

another important
update my daughter
if
s team won today i told her he
t going to win this year she
why i was like long story please go to bed there are more

on
on first watch thought tor was a little slow at times getting into its half court stuff and
t make initial
and
with enough force but

credit for that they make
uncomfortable
really polished stretch run by
they ran their stuff patiently made the right
based on what tor s d did and calmly
down open
thought cliff
the rotation well
s game

live on

is
get the brunt of the criticism and he was no
but


of
combined with


just
t put his imprint on the game at all phi
to find more ways to leverage their size
think back to the night
got injured and how crazy the idea of him
this well in a post season series would have
then great story

clark their long time director of media

say to give you an extent of how wide ranging the upheaval is going to be there today


long been linked to the
job but as and
have
there
been momentum there for
saunders to keep it of course lots of
in flux
potentially on the front office side in min
another candidate to watch i m told

currently w the

understand there
been tension b w
and a part of the front office but we
seen the movie where the
fire a coach just as they are starting to have success fire a good coach winning with a team that
done none of it in

you d better have good plan

ballot part i

coy


part
on the
post
w all
rookie defense

on the pod today
smart was boston s primary defender against

indy s most dangerous perimeter player with
out most natural move would be to start
brown keep hayward rolling off the bench we
see
coming tomorrow my
i think annual
x

post

every first round series with

post
and i reveal our official all
all defense and all rookie
talk
and other individual
and
mess

is the captain now
i knew it
i will reveal the rest of my ballot all
all defense all rookie on the
post
today and talk
because yeah with who will also reveal his ballot
my official
ballot for the


season
dirk forever
he s still going i should have gotten on a plane to la an hour ago maybe i could have made it in time for the end


is not even on the list and it
t seem insane that he s not on the list and what in the hell is even happening

other
of the organization appear to be caught off guard as well
you seriously cannot make this stuff up
if
actually
tonight and
hold on to win we could depending on some other stuff end up in a scenario where


a chance to eliminate his old team from the



tomorrow
meanwhile in

his

are crazy good i am thinking hard about
him on second team

a pink llama as an in arena mascot i was


in the dream to confirm it i might have

what
don t need to rub it in

what was the chance anyone but wade was taking that shot for
most hilarious east outcome is everyone losing enough that
somehow
it in last



home
magic
unfiltered
on a live
in a competitive game is a gamble get the
button ready or better yet don t
what
set the
for this what is his anecdote going to be

i like don t like last

and boston all

all rookie

for the final time this season


i like don t like only we re going all the way to

hill spent most of the season and last just kind of vaguely
now

all
all rookie much more

and i on the mystery of boston and



all
all rookie more

i have
on

therefore i am also an
nominee i will take no further
at this time

buddy
i would pay at least a nominal sum of money for the video of bud diving on the floor and some good player reaction
maybe someone even made a bud face


story
a quote from
that almost made me spit out my water when he said it the one about when he does and
t invite la s young
out with him on the road
we re just out there
the ballad of
and
the unstoppable pick and roll combination driving the league s best bench and
to go

in sixth man voting
the decision to flip to the college game with

left was a good one
these are really great
maybe and i can agree on this if the sauce
bad or
t spicy enough should it have an impact on the vote
and
any recent
post

end of season
here s from last week and this week with great stuff on his wade dirk feature



i like don t like starring the fully
blake griffin the rag tag
and their professional point guard another coach shouting at opponent

have to get the move on part right

real consideration for coach of the year clips have
their team via trade two

thanks for the kind

see you down the line
very excited to read this

to this season s
and
as well
thanks bud
appreciate that sir
the persistence of

how the other key to
s championship

perhaps the league s least likely all star
the last minute here where

about the need for
for people to actually talk to one another instead of living on their
and assuming someone
something about them w o
that person face to face is both obvious and important
really enjoying windy s weekly column this season
on
post pod last week w that this is becoming a very

race slight disagree w windy s opinion that harden
easily if
are taken today i think it would be close
i still think the most absurd and
outcome is
missing the
leaping to no
and

into
the league would not be
at the imbalance of talent a bad team should get him i guess

post
should resume later this week in the
here s the archive of recent
if you
any
after much thought i have
my position on this

have lived through much pain and turmoil

jess well deserved

more other main

will also use if necessary
important point here about
going into hand off mode when he saw
not guarding him if his screen
the guy taking the hand off is open no help defender there
is the master at this
interesting hire this space
more competitive every year
in his first game as a sixer the answer was often and on purpose

which is sort of representative of the bully ball mismatch hunting this team can do in the half court

catching up on some reading now that the deadline

really
this piece by on

s sensational season


graded every trade seriously every one
some nice
off
for both
and
last night

had an up and down season
out how to play with
but i still think there is a really good secondary ball handler attacker in there
was that a little

the


what an incredible capper to the day wow
reviving an old
conceit who s on notice after the trade deadline a round up of what
today some of what
t and what comes now


take benny the bull hostage until they buy him out
would also watch the

a skill set they covet more than almost any team

initially got that

first round pick from
in the
grant deal now getting it back from
here
we almost got my beloved ross for
fake trade phi getting a
of any kind for
is a good deal his trade value was a total mystery obviously worth a look for
the first they are sending out is
city s
pick top


will surely try again around the draft he will have a market
will be fascinated to see how

into
s rotation if he
does serge go back to
what does that mean for
or is serge on board with

as backup c good deal for tor like to see wright get a chance to start in mem




next season so the
have acquired two good
who can help them this season and
up a bit more cap space as both are expiring
multiple
said today that
morris was available for very little likely to get the
under the tax
after trading
for


next season and z bo expiring the
are just about in the
cap space
depending on if where they pick in the draft


the
back into major free agency this summer

have been looking for a big wing the whole season
i wonder if

up agreeing to opt out of
next season final year of deal and sign a new longer term deal w

the criticism
re chi porter here is an interesting one i

from a few
around league that

an already good team but
t super useful earning a huge salary on a bad one valid point
i

he s shady
i m sorry i m on trade duty the
did what now
let sauce shoot all the
he


had
at knight first for
at various
they get
instead and the
get
wonder if that almost
to a

challenge trade sac may still be looking at small forwards as well
maybe we both did maybe the basketball
did
important side note here porter s experience in and around
d c
him an ideal fit for the
leadership council
this is the
being realistic about their cap space and their appeal to free
right now porter is good the
still need someone who can make
but i like the idea behind this deal
for sure worth a look for wiz as well
sometimes i m not a moron

wall s
injury
to have
their approach to porter at the deadline
it s
it s involuntary there s no treatment for it you just have to learn to live around it

back

the live

trade deadline special on
here it is in
form
and this
too for all


always read



one left year on his contract assuming he
in for

next season
vote of confidence in

kind of love this for everyone involved
the

trade never made any sense from the magic s perspective and
worse and worse and worse as time

the many
and leverage
of the

saga with

to go
the other angle of course is that
both butler and

the
some leverage
with each of them no matter what the team
now it is never a cinch to retain four big money

fascinating move for phi who view this is long term big
regardless of tax

say they have now
for two unrestricted free
in the last year of their
in season which is rare probably gave up more in the aggregate for
than for butler
you always have your eye on the ball
and


i can t even remember what i said but i certainly did not see this specific trade coming and thought the
valued
s bird
a little more than this but they got good return dealing a player on an expiring in

the most important development of tonight s
blowout of the
by far is


his most enthusiastic smothered chicken since peak



let s all go get a beer now
wait did the
just pay bank for the
raised franchise player


i have to make that shirt i
on the pod now
what in the world
and from last

post
sit down with dirk
about the
deal
and two
worth of
tales


post
and i pick our most intriguing trade deadline
plus
ad leverage

much more
i think it s important you know i have an
am lunch meeting and the time was the other person s idea
in other important news might be famous
on the
post
trade deadline preview today and i
about the idea of other
getting in the ad

wow man that
a lot thank you but mostly thank dirk for his time his candidness his one legged fadeaway

i
to do this
closer to the trade deadline and further from
s dirk pod but waiting
just become too risky the league is too nutty so here it is

post
and i pick our most intriguing trade deadline
talk
trade buzz much more
this is bad news for anyone who
good
writing

amid
super bowl general being a human on a weekend stuff
post
with the one and only dirk on

the
and
of his historic career
galore
why is he wearing no pants

amid all the trade madness

i like don t like starring
rebound
point book cool

more

post
the one and only dirk on the
deal
one more all star trip and two
of fun


at all star bonding with nash over mutual
the
run much much more
imagine if someone told you before the season
would get
combined
in a game from monte morris malik
and

incredible stuff all season for den s bench and an incredible last month or so for

good stuff from on the ad




centric part of this trade deadline i can t recall anything quite like the ad situation it
so many
and
so many

den
is

at the half i m clearly watching the wrong game
a
night trade deadline preview round up random


buzz

more


just

these
what a season never forget

is a boss

post
the one and only dirk
on the
trade
the
and
of his career one more all star so much more
buckle up boston
to be rattled at this point



i like don t like starring
back all star
an intriguing trade team the
of point book believing in
smart more

was obviously a major side plot in the big ad story and i posted early yesterday
mention of boston being wary of a
team with major cap space and the no
pick
gave a small assist to on his story of what quickly
the
topic amid yesterday s madness is
in play for the
or anyone else
pick
via league memo

next avail dal
rounder unprotected depending on when that

then
either dal

or

round pick top

in all three
if they haven t received
by
they get



make

s injury replacement
the
could use first available pick language to address the issue of the pick they already owe
i m curious for the answer too

on
and it s a shame the
with


as president could not get involved here
a player of
s caliber turning down the sort of deal the
will surely extend him to take the
offer is literally unprecedented i just don t believe
would do it
almost always wrong is what i meant to say here what a
day
right or wrong and the answer w the
is almost wrong i do think front office
feeling like
just
t trust them would never trust them was a factor in them cutting bait at this time early at this price super low unless they have great
on

just landed
dal should call
s bluff on
if he
it
should have to
yes the cap space angle for
double
they d better nail it b c they sold super low on


possibility
grew weary of
s

said enough
some days you almost forget there are basketball

basketball
with
and
on basketball
starting in a few

keep an extra eye on san

she s the one you
me
of right


great to hear jerry
back on commentary with on the
broadcast last night


done good work as jerry s successor but jerry is a legend and
some time to talk about a fun and pretty good
team finally also the



will this be the issue that
the
and
their season
important
story
making a guest appearance on this was a legit honor


and he s the best

he
remember how i
defense on him that s the only accolade i want on
holiday steady amid chaos
as the self
and unqualified court design czar tsar i am happy to bring you the design for this year s all star game court in

via the
i m not usually a fan of the empty paint but i think i like this
one team i
t mention on the
yesterday but i keep seeing
as a potential
suitor the
i just don t see it they already owe two future
and i m not sure any of their non

fit what the
will should want

from a month ago on how the ad situation was reaching a breaking point
post
from yesterday w and on the trade request possible
the
dynamic the
problem more
i


to make a couple of
and i m sorry what
now
i mean i think it s a
shot to the point that i d be absolutely blown away if it
but it s not on its face crazy is all i m saying
in any case
post
w and on all
ad is here
perhaps a trade is inevitable and i might be reading a little much into it but the use of the word transaction here as opposed to situation or something more vague caught my eye

post
and on all


the
advantage boston s holding period other potential
the
for the
and much more
that piece also
into the
trade landscape the
roadblock till

for boston and how there just
t many
that check all the
ad would want
almost exactly a month ago i wrote on how the ad situation had
a crisis point how
had
here and what might happen now
was just
a couple of people from other
about this
now

out in loss column w

to go

to leap
odds depending on source around


wondering if


the point where their trade deadline posture

great great game high intensity and really high level high
play even some of the
were the result of smart pressure defense and switching


might want to listen very carefully to what
buss said on the
post
this week about luke
s job security magic s authority over basketball
and more
put
green s transition defense in

this week
buss on all

shooting line after tonight s game some absolutely
shooting
over the last
days
interesting that the curry durant stagger experiment
been
last

could be over if

rolling
if anyone
a reminder the
can be legitimately alarming
here you are
that was a good

discussion we had on your
today

next four

mil
tor

if the hole
much
as the deadline
you at least have to investigate some unpleasant

few
as hot as smith right now on the trade market
of buzz

harden actually

of
s

at
this is obscene
whoa boy
harden is
going to have to earn that
and that
spot


post
and discuss the nine championship
by
odds

the field much more
i m glad gave tony parker s return game the treatment it
great
about parker s decision to leave san
for
and his
with

and pop
oh

i was like damn den just made a great fake trade
i am less confident than you are would have to catch some
be the right year i think
how are the
getting
in this scenario
for sure but that s the question i
in the piece can
and
win the title if the second third best
are at mil s current level fit talent have to intersect in the right place
contrast b w phi and mil is fascinating on lots of

it in the

piece
the follow up is there i said
would not take that
which was the case for every one of the fake
trade all but one that was the point of the exercise
probably just
to see his retired jersey

now up to almost
from three after his cold start

per game usual solid defense late all star push further
my
i mean come on
please be courteous
this is the
s book by the way if you want to brainwash your
or your

into liking basketball it even
some insider


a process joke


is now
of
and
of
from deep in the last three
of
when the score is within three
via
dot

poor
t get a jersey though

s literature i can really get behind


post
and i bat around the
and nine
chasing them plus bill
a feud with


the
version of this week s

is at the top of the column



i like don t like starring a rising nugget the
beast the shape shifting


beal the all star ballot more

is the best at these
of

i e what is the alternative to re
holiday does this disappointing season open the window to a one year tank and run it back thing as the
did last season nowhere nowhere does it say they should blow it up or trade ad the opposite actually
that piece
t advocate for blowing it up or trading ad it actually
the opposite question in the middle of that disappointing

season is there a better way to build around ad than
with the status quo

and i also made a formal demand for more information about the
leadership council

is on a rookie contract heading toward restricted free agency in like

if

t extend him first
is in the first year of a five year extension
can say yes or no to the
in less than six
same thing though i guess
they have a fancy flavored water machine at bleacher report i got blackberry lime also the
was fun as always with ho beck


post
hoodie hoarder and i bounce around the
and the
for their throne

to broccoli considering the current contractual
of the star
involved
every time

a high profile game there is much media hand
over whether
and
fit digging into that question w help from brett brown plus what a
trade would actually look like spoiler it
t easy
stop trying to prematurely break up the


was similar to how the

harden in



post
and i bounce around the


with the best championship odds

tell us

more please
was starting the process of making my
yesterday

a real case he s
great and east guard
are thin ironically league s insistence that
consider ben
only at guard will hurt

blake griffin
the trade the clipper curse and much more with always enjoy the
i get to talk about the league on court and off court with blake super thoughtful and
interesting
perspective
only two people in human history have said the word ricochet perfectly jerry

trade

was always going to be a buyer considering they owe boston a top

first round pick that otherwise
over they want to get that obligation over with this season and obviously pass along as low a pick as possible
was talking to a couple of
today that both said the next


would prove unusually important in
which
in the middle become


getting ahead of it given current slump
good value for holiday on an expiring considering relative uncertainty about
future holiday is a career
shooter from deep can t hurt to add anther wing in mem
well



per game and
the open catch and shoot
at a clip about
that is borderline acceptable

ball shooting
from the line and
one free throw attempt per game
like a thing that
t getting enough attention considering everything ball


so much attention

somehow failing to match up after made
free


times in the first half leading to easy

is not the best look for a team supposedly
with urgency
this will be great
