people

read the
yourself and tell me who you think could be writing them
i don t think there s anything we can do about it unfortunately
it s sad one thing i
found out is that anonymous
are often not from
but from
who have a specific reason to hide their affiliation identity
the disgraceful behavior of some of the

is a rare but glaring exception
i want to stress that the vast majority of people in the python
open source community are good people over the

in the future we
have
that generate

from a script or new video
from a description it s only a matter of
at this point
as usual with deep learning scaling up is paying off

e is the kind of application that you d expect deep learning to be able to pull off in theory people have been building various early prototype of text
image generation since
that becomes really magical when done at a crazy scale
building machine learning
that work on
with


the

look really cool especially image generation it s basically an extension of

to text and

i think each research niche e g

and feature engineering

our current growth rate is solid and our
for
are looking bright i
post an update to these metrics in
here s to another year full of improvement growth and
on delighting our

overall

been a difficult year in particular one during which many
have cut their exploratory
in deep learning because of covid causing a slump from march to
however on balance


still seen modest growth over the year
note that the
metrics are only for the

not the
of large
adjacent
like the



finally
metrics

it possible to track new
over the last year but
t make it possible to track new


hence why i m
total
for these rather than


deep learning research is an important but small niche

of deep learning out of several millions in total and it is the only niche where
is neck to neck with

we can track usage in the research community in two

which
pure deep learning research and
scholar which
all


of deep learning to biology medicine


in
job
is a metric that i m not quite sure is meaningful unfortunately it
t reflect the stack of
that hire only the
tracked by

note that the
survey listed both
and

had very strong metrics and i suspect many people checked
without

so if

was a choice it would have significantly higher
here probably around

there were two

luxury is being able to spend your time doing
that matter to you in a self directed way
it s possible because they don t believe in democracy and you won t be able to stop them by merely appealing to their integrity it s like
how it is possible for covid to proceed to infect more people after seeing how many people have already
it
t care
i don t usually reply to bad faith
by far right
but the full recording is in fact available

these
show a blatant attempt at large scale election fraud i m glad there are so many republican
who are passionate about
integrity i m sure they
start a committee to investigate this scandal
if anything remote work

more attractive because of the disappearance of the workplace as the main point of socialization
what

attractive is the
more than the
even assuming a lasting and extensive move to remote work which would be a great thing
will bounce back when the pandemic is over
and remember it s not a gain until you
sold it and
your

any speculative bubble i e no value
is money redistribution from those who buy late to those who bought early and sell around the peak if you re hearing about it in the news we re near the peak and your gain expectation is negative


yes it
too and
maintenance but value
faster than it

one
engineer working on their own can achieve dramatically more today
to

ago there s never been a more exciting time to work in this field
yes fixed
you should use a more advanced model for that like

you get face like
after


but
keep improving after that
shown in the notebook are from around


lots of great
in this thread thanks a lot to everyone who

this is an important feature
need to be able to use the same layer with different trainable
in different
the model will warn you if trainable

since the last compile
each logical step in the training loop
to one line of code exact
from mental model to implementation that training loop
distributed training and
training out of the box without the user
to work for it
here s a very concise
implementation in

arbitrary deep learning

t get simpler than that
of course see
we re
that
please see these

in particular eager execution


will remain multiple
for
we will be
this feature within a couple of

happy new year to you too
is the issue with the
format or

should be able to do this
have you tried use the sequence class
you should be able to do this straightforwardly in a custom train step just use one
per layer iterate over the
and do e g opt i apply
zip
slice i
i trainable


can you be more specific
in your opinion what s a feature that
is missing or otherwise something that
does poorly at this time be extremely specific precise

signature thanks
what s hard is to improvise from little experience in the face of high uncertainty and novelty that s what biological intelligence

for that s what current
and
can t do at all
no matter how stupid the student they can always pass the exam if you give them a set of
very similar to what they will be tested on reduced task uncertainty and if they re willing to spend countless

them more experience
intelligence simply
moving to a different part of the specificity effort spectrum one where you can master broad
with little effort you can always make up for a lack of intelligence by reducing task uncertainty making x more specific or
more effort
ai can always do specific
as long as they re sufficiently specific and you re
sufficient effort data the problem with ai
t that it can t do a specific x it s that it
basically no intelligence at all at this time no general cognitive

the thing with pointing out ai can t do x is that if you keep refining x into something narrow and precise enough you
eventually cross a threshold where a realistic amount of engineering and training data make x possible

is finally here happy new year everyone
i guess i m just lazy
it
surprising me how much easier it is to do difficult
when you re ignorant of what you
have to do not just the
you
face but the sheer number of
that will be involved
are the
special or does the effect come from tuning a subset of the
of each layer
it should be more effective to distribute the trainable
throughout the model rather than just train one single layer of equivalent size somewhere in the model experiment would be to train random subset of each weight variable can be
with

in general only fine tuning a small subset of the parameter on any large
model in any domain is competitive with sometimes better than fine tuning the entire model because these
start
quickly it s a powerful form of regularization
we are surrounded by intelligent
ecological collective cultural that we don t readily recognize as intelligent because they don t have a body analogous to ours
that


later
maybe it s more acceptable because
are supposed to have more agency over their

to dogs
how do we know we re treating a dog well or poorly by the fact it
happy or
anxious if so what do we make of the fact that most
are
into stressful and anxiety laden


that pass the
test are to ai research what a

show in
is to physics research and yes his
do involve some amount of physics and engineering
if you were trying to assess that a matter

by
an audience of
about it you d be encouraging the development of prestidigitation
not research in physics this is the same the
test
deception not progress
as a result the
test does not at all provide
to develop greater intelligence it solely

to figure out how to trick
into believing a
is intelligent
the major flaw of the
test is that it entirely
the responsibility of
intelligence and how to evaluate it the value of a test instead it
the task to human
who themselves don t have a proper definition or a proper evaluation process
the
test was never a relevant goal for ai we should remember that
never intended it as a literal test to be
by a machine designed for that purpose but as a philosophical device in an argument about the nature of thinking
by that point you can t isolate
research as the source of the
you have to fix the entire system
ultimately
will always be just one part of a bigger system and
research will always just be one slice of the
of that system often the easiest and least problematic part the
arise when the entire system

of course education and a rich cultural life as well as free time to enjoy it
some level of material wealth but my subjective impression both at the individual and national
is that those with the highest living
by my metrics are often not the

on a bigger scale i d argue that a nation that
top quality education and access to a rich cultural life to its
is providing a better standard of living than one that
a higher
per
but that is largely a cultural wasteland
while it is necessary to be financially comfortable to have a rich cultural life in particular because you need free time it s often much
than
the sort of
that society would normally associate with being rich
lots of
of this tweet it does not imply that these two
are
nor that they re independent it simply
that a rich cultural life

and in a strong sense
your life worth living more than material luxury
the purpose of culture is not to get rich it s the reverse the only satisfying use of money is to enjoy culture in all its

on paper that to type the exact same

one may be able to read without being able to speak or even without being able to understand speech and inversely it s also a lot easier to passively understand than to express oneself
speaking a language is not a binary it s a multidimensional spectrum not only that but speaking understanding speech reading and writing are all distinct
and while they re highly synergistic they overlap a lot less than one may think

i agree
can absolutely do more to fight
and avoid
to radicalization i am not involved with
but it is my understanding that they take the problem very seriously and they have made great progress since

which is far more momentous and historically significant
i don t think history will remember someone like
as a
pioneer he will be
as the man who was in charge of ai at
during the decade when
s

democracy
and triggered a global wave of far right

it
that several minor far right
individually outperform the
on
it s not a concentration issue
do trump supporting

have a say in what their algorithm
in fact they do
in a majority democrat country nearly

is it because only

or is it because

amplify far right propaganda at the expense of all else
imagine what would have
behind close
if the election were run on voting

by a federal agency with a president
head
chance of a free election
i think this
highly to the robustness of
democracy many
would not survive a single term with a
autocrat in charge
the
election was a referendum on autocracy period and because almost


since the

inauguration it will take a bit more than an election to move on but it s still entirely doable at this stage
turns out that if you put an authoritarian in power once it s pretty difficulty to get rid of them and it
exponentially more difficult the longer they stay imagine trying to ask
to leave the presidency in
after

had he won the
election
for those outside the us this is the secretary of state of the incumbent regime promising that the president who lost the election by a wide margin will stay in power
on some level you know this is just about firing up the base to increase turnout for the
runoff and extract additional
to pay off campaign debt but at the end of the day it s still exactly what autocracy
like

days to go
it s just theater extremely unlikely to result in an actual coup attempt but lots of
will be happy to humiliate themselves in the process regardless
as i understand the main productivity issue in the covid era comes from school
a fully distributed

far fetched especially in the bay area which is going to have

three
of

reality is that which when you stop believing in it
t go away
empathy is to extend an open hand not to pretend that
are worth just as much as
that character
t matter that the rule of law is just as nice as corruption and autocracy these
do matter remember
in

the way forward is to say you have an equal place in our world and we will work together to implement
that benefit you but

is categorically unacceptable fully
who trump was and what he stood for is a necessary step towards healing
this is a question you should ask mark

back to work
trump always goes for the monumental self own rather than admit the
mistake it s his character narcissistic and oblivious
and a
not so bright staffer had to make it happen anyway by booking another four
so that their boss could be right they scrolled down the search
and found four
total
there you go they said hurriedly dialing the number
it s extremely implausible that someone mistakenly booked four
total
for a press conference thinking it was the hotel more likely is that trump
about his press conference at the four
then

the hotel which
to host it
young people are more liberal primarily because as a demographic block they re more diverse
one more twitter is not equivalent to
if you re one of the people
to this thread with but
i urge you to get off
you re being


sex

of sexual assault against trump the
of climate
are not equivalent to the
of conservative think
and so on the two sides are not in fact symmetrical
and no


are not equivalent to fox news conspiracy
against
s family are not equivalent to trump s actual corruption

are not equivalent to far right
life saving medical
are not equivalent to life


maybe the most glaring asymmetry is what was at stake in this election
won and trump
have nothing to fear from this result in policy
they
actually end up better off had trump won many people would have definitely not been

were at stake
empathy is good
for unity are good but let s stop
that the two sides are symmetrical and morally equivalent stop saying oh you think x is bad but the other side just
the same about you along every dimension the picture is incredibly lopsided
i
actually
with a fair number of trump
over the past four
to try to understand how they see the world a noticeable pattern is that they live in an alternate reality with its own set of alternative
and that s often sustained via

this is also a good take there is a severe education deficit in this country without quality education there can be no collective future
this is a good take need to overhaul the entire social media ecosystem to achieve better information hygiene make the user be in control of how they consume information instead of being

the choice was between this guy or the other guy and slightly less than half of all
went for the other guy how do you even begin to fix that
did they change their algorithm can t believe this is not

to

this is still the most plausible way to explain the press conference in the four
total
parking lot and consistent with his past behavior
he always go for the ridiculous self own rather than admit the
mistake remember the sharpie map
anyway i m very happy to see this episode of
end in comedy instead of tragedy
how will anyone ever manage to write comedy
after
i don t know

this tweet was

another thing that
surprising me after

t foresee it you
t have been their friend if you could i just can t come to
with the awfulness so i just keep getting my heart broken with every news
time and time again i keep believing in everything good about

breaking my heart like in

because it would mean
such a low view of

will get bluer over time as mail in

but i hoped we d see a clear winner tonight and the fact that it s looking unlikely is disappointing beyond


remember that it will take a while to get accurate
and that early extrapolation from small sample sizes is not reliable
today in particular stay away from fox news and
propaganda is a weapon
this election is about decency honesty science based policy the rule of law it s about respect the equal respect every citizen
from their
and the respect that the us may earn again in the
of the world if you haven t already vote today
the reason why high turnout overwhelmingly

is simply that low turnout is a consequence of voter suppression and voter suppression

should not be cast as

who care about each other this

this goes well together with the belief that paying

a certain type of people will immediately say you re virtue

of people working in ai in the late
and early
those who were actively or passively involved in
democracy and those who
them
the
government is running an initiative
go to campaign to my surprise it is not about
the
statement in imperative

making
do something is only useful when you need to do the thing
of time without human supervision good propaganda
tight supervision and only a small number of
of content and




is not hard
despite all the
about
actual
of

used for political propaganda still use good

that s because social media
trend towards a
a small number of targeted well

not large
of obvious

wow this
up check out my

thanks for
this work to my attention
here s the paper which
how a model with just

can drive a car not unlike how c
can generate useful behavior despite
very few
explanation video
neural circuit
is a promising new architecture inspired by biological
it
to very small
that can handle complex
this simplicity
it more robust and more interpretable work done with

available on

agree that elevating a legal document into a sacred text
t healthy in this case it s equivalent to saying our
are perfect as is
should never be
if it s
by people people should be able to discuss it
change it
agree about executive power
too much weight in the
republic guess they
have to rewrite the thing at some point
anyway a constitution is simply a legal document that
how your government works it s not the holy scripture you can modify it and if you need to modify it a lot you can rewrite it it s not sacrilege and occasionally it s necessary
i have no dog in this fight i m only
that a rewrite of a very old constitution
t a crazy move a constitutional crisis can justify it it s actually pretty standard
should probably be considered at least once a century though
can increase the lifetime of a constitution inversely it s profoundly odd to have a constitution last for
without a major rewrite p probably
it is no longer fit for the current world

of government
t meant to be set up once and left running forever
your constitution is a rare but valid move it
t throw the country into chaos to the contrary it s something that you do in times of intense government crisis that
order
when a system of government is not working out it is standard operating procedure to propose a new constitution and have it
via referendum
the old one last time it
in
was in
and it was a success that constitution remains in place today

afternoon track
this thought brought to you by my
to increase my
in logic pro x like it s some kind of

you learn by doing if you do more you learn more so the speed at which you do

learning

learning to type fast anything that
you move faster in your target activity
you level up faster
but i will say it s pretty shocking how many
can be
away if you direct a sufficiently powerful jet of
at them you could even convince people going through a catastrophic recession that actually the economy is doing great
the only way they know how to deal w
is to continuously lie about them until enough people believe the
there s no problem we have it under control it s fake news

t work too well when the problem is a virus that
t care if you believe in it
it
pretty
that

into a deadly pandemic the people in charge of leading the response are still
basic science and are knowingly lying to the public in ways that will directly lead to more
at what point does it start
as criminal
it should go without saying but if you test more and quarantine positive
and the people they
been in contact with you keep the spread under control and you end up with

keep test positivity rate as low as possible and the of
as high as possible
might as well be working directly for the trump campaign at this point
if you
to my thread don t feel
i just thought many of the
were pretty funny in a good way
what i like about twitter is that you don t have to explicitly say bad
only to start a bad
only thread it s the default

electrification is also a strong contender
not too long ago it
t uncommon to start collective
intended to take multiple
to complete


agricultural
building a cathedral could take


what are some
of such
generational
today
classical music is a genre of music actually it
many
it s a grab bag of everything
before the
century no actually it s the narrow slice of musical production
for the consumption of a

elite between
and

in compile loss lone output loss

i have never seen any hate coming from any

in general most people across the
community are great but not all unfortunately
the reason is appreciation there is no need for any further justification
new personal policy whenever i get a hate
i m
someone i like and sending them a note to tell them i appreciate them
keep the balance in the force
i don t mind video
but i draw the line at
with in

those have design
that inevitably point towards a b


i don t mind
and i don t mind recommender
but i draw the line at algorithmic
when i want to see content
based on my past consumption i
ask for it i don t need it
to me every time i open an

i don t mind electronic
but i draw the line at connected
those tend to have more power over you than you have over them
for a
to make sense it needs to make the underlying
significantly easier simpler i e

and reduce cognitive load it also need to focus on the difficult
of the

not model definition e g data management
problem definition
the problem with model

is that they only cover the easy part of the


a
model and they don t make it meaningfully easier the

are the same and the cognitive load on the user is the same except now it s visual instead of code
i think ultimately there will be an ide for deep learning but

will be a very small part of it it should cover everything from data management data exploration
search
and evaluation
in music composition

is extremely similar to creative writing while production
sound is extremely similar to painting you could say music is the combination of creative writing and painting
what are we looking at there have been many

for

over the



a brand new introductory course for deep learning check it
i bought a keyboard an logic pro x in may quarantine oblige and i
been making
on
since
it s done not sure it
as
but in any case it
the groove
me making an
track so first of all boom boom boom boom boom boom nice now we need some clap boom clap boom clap boom clap ah excellent perfect this is it
one of the most concerning
about the united
of
in
is the
of the
the judiciary
t be a political tool in the
of the executive in the long term that s incompatible with a free society future
must address this
you could apply this to the military right now fight well to win this year s
strategize well to win the next war economic development and tech r
d
and a system that never
cannot be successful over an indefinite

for you as an individual long term success thus
on learning and exploration

of success of a system over different
short term execution medium term strategy long term meta make a better system

we

recently that i m extremely excited about

cloud add one line to your notebook or project to start training your model in the cloud in a distributed way

you d need to review more
than
as the number of potential bad
is
than the number of good

someone should write an engineering management book that
a series of
of case
each pair
of two initially similar
one a success the other a failure we
t learning enough from failure
i want to create
that inspire people to create more

the honest answer is that we don t know we have no data can t even draw historical
with other
since the us is in a unique situation along most

there are many
why but basically the more people search for something under a catchy name the less familiar they are with it so search is a proxy for x is gaining awareness among a new audience that previously
t know about it

usage was still increasing at a good pace until covid hit
did decay during the covid crash nothing too dire but are starting to trend upwards again now in general search

t a good proxy for tech usage try plotting
to convince yourself
imagine gaslighting so hard even
can smell the

very
fly extremely unfair hit job
on this day in

chance of winning today it s
for
i m pretty confident in

but keep that in mind
in your opinion what are the
that will eventually land trump in jail
tax fraud tax evasion money

sexual assault

the disheartening lesson here you can still catch covid even if you follow none of the official advice and people will still mistrust you even if you spend
never telling the truth
music production is my passion
me working with logic spend
min on melody spend
min on arrangement spend

trying out every instrument in the library

morning track
my current mood pretty well
a leader who
the truth can use the trust
in them to lead the way out you can t follow someone you can t trust
the way to avoid panic in a crisis is to tell the truth
information and lying even if done to avoid panic just
more chaos and anxiety and it leaves people without a
figure to follow
it s crazy that we have to decode the truth from
like this zero transparency endless

apparently he tested positive on
morning rapid test may have been infectious during the debate
it cannot be
how much trump s enduring support
on total suspension of reality meanwhile recent
are likely to trigger a massive back to reality
the last four
are coming to an end
by not wearing a mask you
t
strength and confidence you are
that you don t understand basic hygiene and that you have no concern for
who may be more at risk than you behave like an adult mask up
wear a mask and follow social

as we
known since march this is serious respect the health of
around you


to have low level
is also an anti pattern insufficient abstraction the best model to follow is progressive disclosure of complexity a hierarchy of
of abstraction where each level
on top of the previous one in an incremental way

by
the it
t matter crowd is missing the point it s valuable information that the president
tax fraud is a
business man is probably in debt and is suspect of money
it s a big story it
t matter if it
the mind of a single fanatic
by the time the pee tape
it will be by far the least scandalous thing about this whole train wreck it won t even last

in the news cycle
it will take a while to figure out what fraction of trump s

are due to his business
and what fraction is plain accounting fraud any

i believe large
don t spend nearly enough time thinking about meta
like is our promotion process effective do the
we create align with our long term
is our recruiting process effective
should be a large fraction of what
do
you may not like it but this is what peak crustacean

this is only one of many amazing
about

one of my favorite evolution
crab morphology is an attractor point of the crustacean evolution manifold various crustacean species independently tend to become crab like over time it s


if you are in a position of immense influence psychological control even over
of millions of people and you deliberately choose to do the former for money then you are absolutely evil period

have that potential you can choose to either encourage people s worst
exploit their
and their ignorance and cultivate their hate or you can choose to fight against it
honestly the take the fact that it
in the

that it s part of human nature and therefore it s fine to encourage it
my mind of course it s part of human nature this realization is at the core of what never again

to quote
is a profoundly unethical company and it
at the top fully aware of its own immense influence power
deliberately
to use it in service of far right radicalization in order to create engagement


fanning the
of hate
you more engagement and it s
to do it because it
before in the
with nothing bad coming from it
i made a new track i was told i should start giving them
so this is my first track with a title
have power
to name something
you to put some effort into it
the
effect
the interface of a compiler which
its
language and surrounding tooling is very complex a
cannot master it in a few

a hallmark of great design is the
to complexity ratio being able to do lots of
via a very simple interface a world of
that even a
can learn to access in a minute the
interface is a good example of that as was the original

it s also something you see in immature creative
seeking to make prose more complex with the intent to make it appear more prose like when the better approach is actually to reduce it to its
form
most scientific
which tend leverage complexity of form in order to appear serious and clever sometimes to cover triviality of substance
i can forgive constructive complexity abstract philosophy high art but the addition of unnecessary complexity specifically for the purpose of excluding as many people as possible is all too common and something to push back against
the more complex you make something even if it s only structured constructive complexity the more people you are excluding simplicity is accessibility
except for that one odd friend who goes trump is up against unspeakable
it will take time be patient

of

in the us right now are people posting can t wait for that



indictment to drop and each of their

any time now i m ready to watch the firing squad and they
done it every day for the past


thank you for the great contribution

no one is ready for the chaos we will see from
to
he will try to cling to power no matter what even if he is resoundingly
which is likely he will try to burn the country down on his way out like a narcissistic abuser feeling
by his victim
it s a necessary step the alternative is simply the end of the us as a democratic republic but it s only the first step and the outcome is not

the level of societal
that
it possible for someone like trump to become president and complete a full term with the unconditional support of a major party

of the population is terrifying you may get rid of him but the bigger issue will still be there
what are some

you find useful but
t well known

random
is a pretty solid
agent if you spend enough effort tuning the random seed
the take it will only kill the elderly so it s fine we don t need to do anything is also not unique to the us it s a far right message found throughout the world
i think the dynamic at play here is trust in expert value human life
pro
anti intellectualism and anti
value individual freedom over human life
anti

in general it s helpful to look at the rest of the world to understand the us since it
what s unique about the us and what s just a manifestation of

and general equilibria
this is a strange take in virtually every country the center left
been pro
and the far right
been anti
the center right is usually pro
as well but not as much as the center left if it were stochastic there would be many

that explicit clear mental model is an order of magnitude more difficult than
a master s intuition but once you have it you can transmit it unlike intuition it is
and communicable
can even improve upon it
doing
well out of intuition without truly understanding why the path you are choosing is the correct one
a tremendous amount of practice and immersion but even a beginner can do
well if they are given a crystal clear mental model of the how and the why

in their time but not what i m looking for and i suspect not what he was really looking for either
yes this one

this was the central idea of

essay we keep
new neuropsychological
by the
while these
may seem locally interesting they don t add up to a whole we re missing a holistic theory

later it remains true
we have
a huge body of knowledge about the brain but because that knowledge is purely descriptive not explanatory we actually understand very little about how the brain works
these are not data
these are organizational and cultural
the fact that a


an issue is actually the outcome of the entire system team diversity will help with these
organically but
formal
is necessary by now

in the event that you end up training a model on a

why was the

saying that bias in ai
is just because of the

technically it s true but it s
out the last link in the causality chain while
the entire system around it
in a democracy those really in power

unless they let go of that power and just accept to be
over so vote it s the antidote

love your neighbor as yourself act out of hope not spite i don t think anyone out there is choosing
to spite trump

the reasoning is he will hurt those

who will vote for him not because they like him but because he

really
based on meta
about the study itself with no knowledge of

when you re considering a system you don t understand well it s very error prone to try to exhaustively list everything that is possible and
a given impossibility is always probabilistic the
multiply
this

principle once you eliminate the impossible whatever remains no matter how improbable must be the truth which is usually wrong

the same is often true with research try to reinvent first look up the literature afterwards if you want to be able to produce original
you need to create space for them to develop instead of always filling up empty
of concept space with ready made

it s much more effective to labor your way through your own original solution and only look at the official solution afterwards if you don t it you
be completely unprepared to approach something actually new
when i studied math and physics i had big
of practice
the tentation was always to jump to the solution section and memorize the method if you do it for enough
you should be able to pattern match your way through any new problem right wrong
there s a big difference between learning to solve
on your own and learning to look up

if you want to unlock your potential learn the former if you want to unlock ai s potential teach it the former the goal is to memorize as little as possible

it s actually about
the problem it s literally feature engineering but you re right that as long as you have infinite training data and infinite compute
it s less work not to do any feature engineering at all
because you want to achieve generalization via interpolation and forcing the interpolative model to deal with a huge layer of discrete complexity code syntax is a big hurdle for that the simpler the structure of your target space the better it s curve fitting after all

never seen hate speech that had any intellectual value so you re not weakening the public debate by refusing to tolerate it you re actually strengthening freedom of expression by making everyone feel safe when

group as inferior undesirable or deserving violence that s it
tolerance of this type of thing would mean making female
feel less welcome less accepted and overall less safe which
against our
of fostering free expression likewise you can t tolerate

it s a precondition to establish a safe

if let s say an employee
a screed about how female
are biologically less capable of doing their job i would actually fire that person not because they said something i disagree with i
t care less but because
let s say for ex that i m running a tech company innovation is our life blood we want people to express their

an organization or nation that
to encourage dissent cannot tolerate hate speech notice how
that score the highest on press freedom also have strong hate speech
not a coincidence
note free speech and hate speech
t best
they re mortal
if you want to foster an environment where people freely express dissent
unconventional

of
to everyone in the us
it
t have to turn out like this it
been half a year and we already know what works
education is about collectively turning our civilization into its best possible future education is open ended optimization over the space of
it
t merely job training
perhaps even more essential is the realization that education is about maximally
human potential it is about leading each individual towards the best version of themselves about
and
what they could be in a best case scenario
what took
of
to discover may be forgotten in a few
and we can t afford to let that happen
the default state of our culture our technology our science our
is not eternal progress it is fast decay without proper education the next generation
and soon enough
fall into decadence we re
it right now
it is the steel making up an uninterrupted chain of cultural transmission accretion and renewal
back to the emergence of language back when
first
truly human
crucially education is civilization building education is the process through which the body of knowledge and culture that we have been
for
of

from our generation to the next one
both are largely missing the mark certainly job training and in general

to productively function in modern society is one goal of education but it is far from the only one and it
t even the most critical one
as
we define the value of learning as the future practical usefulness of the
we pick up am i going to need algebra and as
we focus on marketable
that are
by

in the modern mind education is all about young people

that are useful to their future
learn to read learn to write learn to program
that will enable them to function in society and make a good living education as job training
few
have done as much damage as the notion that education is merely about the acquisition of marketable
education is the vehicle through which civilization
itself through time from one generation to the next
increase education and you
get to the next degree of civilization in


cut education and you
be going backwards the cost is steep
if there s one take away of the past few
it s that it s a practical and moral imperative to invest as much as we can in education education is the precondition for civilization

but not today

what s not acceptable in person is not acceptable

i think we really overlook the psychological impact of
abuse and

of bigotry it can alter career

why social media must do more to fight against it

absent that broad overview your learning of the field is stunted absent a broad diverse culture your mind itself is stunted
a practical consequence of this is that diving into a new field should always be done breadth first not depth first you will learn faster and more effectively if you can connect new specialized information to a broad overview of your field

from how it s connected to everything else in your mind as such learning is the art of

the most unrealistic part of the wandering earth was the notion that humanity could channel all of its

it s a universally safe assumption that what we see now is not the truth it is at best a fragment of the truth at worst a lie skepticism is to internalize that fact the scientific spirit is to first accept that fact then nevertheless seek to find more of the truth

a better model would be
as a set of possible

the public and
conditioned on these
this would involve actually modeling transmission and economic social activity rather than fitting a curve
that s what
me off with these
they don t appear to acknowledge that how the future turns out is a consequence of our
they start from the assumption that the curve will go flat and then they fit a curve that
past data plus this unjustified assumption
perhaps it will perhaps it won t but it s an odd thing for a model to assume since our future response cannot be
from past data you might as well make the reverse assumption gradual
will cause the trajectory to change course in the wrong direction
this is exactly what

what you re really saying with this argument is the society we
built for ourselves is more ruthless and deadly than a pandemic
to stop working for a while or working from home should not be considered worse than catching a deadly virus

you can leverage built in functionality like the progress bar

that s new in

in
the fraction of people worried about covid

been falling everyone is talking about
the economy stocks are up it s all entirely rational

this is progressive disclosure of complexity at work exactly the amount of low level control over the

performance optimization that s exactly the reason why to use a framework
you can call compile
fit on this bad boy it

it
built in distribution support
it does everything fit usually does but with your own low level training algorithm

is actually simply this
you get used to anything or to the lack of anything all it
is time
you can play with the code here
there will be a second edition presumably
at the end of

the left version is a bit more verbose but that s because it s significantly lower level the right version would require a bit more background to understand

t the end it could be the beginning but if you don t read and if you display absolute intellectual arrogance your journey is already over before it

the moral of this story is this if you set out to solve ambitious
what you need most
t
of
in
you need an attitude of doubt
perpetual learning you need to read
you can t be supremely confident in the
you think you know
b oh well it s not like you really need a
in any of these
you could just read a lot of
and
and catch up a no here s the thing they don t read
not even ai

they only read

b a are you getting it now
b oh
i guess they must be the mathematician or physicist type then that would be so in character a no they don t really have any strong math background either
deep learning
a dialogue a so these
are very confident that they will develop superhuman ai within a few
b cute i guess that neuropsychology degree is really paying off for them a no no they don t have any background in
or psychology
i don t understand deep learning
the idea that
is the only piece of
worth

investigating a view often
by the same absolute
who think all we need to get to human level intelligence is a bigger
model
test and trace would an effective alternative to get to a progressive decrease in the number of
we need test and trace the real question is whether the us can implement it perhaps some
can
the only way out is either herd immunity or mass vaccination which is much further in the future
like in many similar exponential growth
exponential friction
linear growth is the stable point or rather
with a period of


around linear growth

linear growth is almost inevitable because we have a dynamic system on our
faster growth
to

in the short term


to decreasing
after

which
some people will resume activity resulting in faster growth
the current level of
in the us
to be yielding linear growth for the virus to be confirmed over the next couple of
with a fairly high slope this
t good we need at scale
every new problem you solve
you with
and
that make you better prepared to solve the next problem seeking out novelty
difficulty



in some rare
though it does make it predictable like what
in late
early march or what is happening today when something predictable is coming that is so big that you know the market will have to adjust eventually though you can t know when
the market being irrational uninformed and late to react rarely
it more predictable if anything it
it less predictable if the market reflected a rational and well informed model of the future you would only need a better model in order to stay ahead of it
only in v rare
when you know a predictable event is so big that the market will have to eventually react to it but even then you don t know when since the market is irrational it s nearly impossible to predict when or how much it will react to predictable

i guess it will be a real surprise when the market
again then much like no one could have possibly
covid
becoming a problem until march if market
were informed you would never see big
major
don t become abruptly more or less likely
the stock market
t some kind of hive brain
it s a bunch of irrational people and
acting irrationally
it
t the stock market is extremely short
and
to react to big
long after they
already become obvious in this case the market is likely
to recent good news about covid
growth and will be late in
to the upcoming recession
if you want to scam your way to a scientific career prefer

whatever you re building make it not awful

buy us time to set up an extensive testing
isolating system which is the only way to contain the virus before a vaccine if you want to know when the epidemic will be over ask yourself how much progress have we made on that system
the reason for the
is to stop the exponential spread of the virus if we go back to normal now exponential spread

in
given how that was handled the current criminally incompetent crisis response is par for the course
there s also the fact the depressing testing
the virus more difficult to contain and far more likely to spread which you
it will also contribute to a general panic besides you know getting more people

this is a great point deliberately depressing testing is a terrible strategy to prevent general panic besides being incredibly irresponsible because it

you want someone willing to represent everyone in the country who will work to achieve effective policy

i don t have the

perhaps a team of

with direct experience with covid
know what they re talking about more than casual

forward testing is the ultimate test of a
model
i e to generalize how course the term structure is completely informal so not accurate here but not that s not a
for twitter
no it does i could give you any number of
you can always fit a continuous function to a set of discrete
split
training

but the more structure they have the more the continuous function will be likely to intercept data
not in your training set
if you re a malarkey enthusiast today is not your day
this is what a query of what was put in

the

is not the same as a
in the sense that it s capable of
local generalization via interpolation much like any parametric function that you fit to a manifold of data it
non zero generalization power but that s still local generalization
the conversion is from past operating space to future operating space
intelligence is the ratio with which your ai
information about a task into skill at that task importantly the task is typically not static so skill here
future
which may be very unlike past

if your ai needs an excruciatingly exhaustive description of its task as an explicit
program or as a dense sampling of a static data manifold it
t actually intelligent when you operate it you re just querying the information you put into it no autonomy
one way to describe intelligence is as the ability to understand something from a partial description how
this description can be is a measure of intelligence

with their prior knowledge and their highly general cognitive
handle this just fine
to be clear if each arc task came with


you could most likely train a
model on each task and shove arc that way but they don t you get


per task so now you have to exhibit some intelligence not just fit a curve
the very point of cognition is to be able to operate given an insufficient description of the operation space that s what intelligence is intelligence is not curve fitting
it s no different than the fact that you can approximate an arbitrary discrete function with a continuous one this
to arc as well but doing this curve fitting
a very precise description of what you are trying to approximate a dense sampling
no it s a highly structured space which can therefore be
in a continuous manifold if you can sample enough
which is a really ridiculous amount of
this is true for virtually any task as i was saying

if i give you a natural language description of the
of chess and a couple of example
then chess is a reasoning problem if i give you



example
it s a pattern recognition problem or at least it can be
as one
it s also not the case that some

are discrete or interpolative all
can be
with pattern recognition if the problem is stable and you have infinite data inversely

is pattern
but in a single shot setting it becomes a reasoning problem
it s not syntax
is a pattern recognition problem which is
by the fact that human who learn
can handle syntax grammar intuitively without
to reason about it

purely based on pattern recognition intuition
an insane amount of training data a dense sampling of the manifold that s not how
play for best efficiency we rely on an
mix of intuition and explicit reasoning




this trade off well the better the
the lesser the need to rely on
it also really
how explicit reasoning e g

much greater experience efficiency in
high skill i e greater intelligence

these
involve a mixture of pattern recognition what a player would call intuition and explicit reasoning it s not all or nothing the better you are at pattern recognition the less you need to rely on reasoning and inversely


a


challenge make a model that
a
feed and
when someone

besides making the learning practically tractable the smoothness
continuity of the function
the
of its fitting work great to learn to approximate latent manifold but its
are also its

generalization in deep learning is interpolation along a latent manifold or rather a learned approximation of it it
little to do with your model itself and everything to do with the natural organization of your data

is applicable when you re doing pattern recognition when you have data that
on a smooth manifold along which
can be
and you re going to need a dense sampling of your manifold as training data in order to fit a parametric approximation of it

i think thoughtful design can dramatically broaden the impact and reach of
there are no complicated
in deep learning only bad

so with something like
you won t have to switch to an entire different framework as you go from student to researcher or from data scientist to deep learning engineer
when you zoom in the incremental complexity is still part of the same picture everything you re learning in the beginning will still be relevant once you
become an expert you will be gradually diving into
where you re writing more and more logic from scratch
a key design principle i follow in
e g
is progressive disclosure of complexity make it easy to get
yet make it possible to handle arbitrarily flexible use
only
incremental learning at each step like
in a complex landscape
perhaps you do need special training to think constructively but i d argue people s own life experience is that training
to be more original
diverse than the thinking that comes from a degree
leave the thinking to the
is a very academic take you don t need a degree in order to reflect on what you re familiar with
we re not going to get to generality overnight we re going to
climb there with ai of increasing flexibility
increasingly broad
if you re moving in that direction it should be enough and more realistic to say you re working on
ai
people ask me if
is such a
term what should people interested in generality call it it s a research direction not a destination a pragmatic answer is to call it broad ai or simply artificial cognitive
in opposition to task specific

introduction to deep learning course at

i
an artificial
who was the best and most electable
candidate and it said warren so now it s official i don t make the
sorry
it s elementary but many deep learning
are not aware of this because in
of the work they
ever done the model s score on the test set was the finality most
research
from an

and
at a test set score
well understood meaning either that it can be explicitly
by a programmer or that you can amass a
that densely
the distribution of possible
which must be static
if every possible situation is known and you want to

and cost reduction go with the model
exist to encode and
human cognition in well understood

if significant uncertainty is involved go with the human they may have inferior pattern recognition
versus
trained on enormous
of data but they understand what they do they can reason about it and they can improvise when faced with novelty
so when
the question would you rather use a model that was
as
accurate or a human that was
as
accurate the answer
on whether your data is typical per the evaluation process
are adaptable
are not
the finance industry
a saying for this past performance is no guarantee of future
your model scoring x on your test

t mean it will perform at level x on the next n
it
in the real world the future may not be like the past
the number one thing to keep in mind about machine learning is that performance is
on
from one
but the model is used in production on
that may not necessarily follow the same



error lower is better
progress on the abstraction
reasoning challenge

is it
is probably the first thing you should ask about any cultural product meant for mass consumption which naturally

and political

basically the president
t
in spite of being an over the top billionaire villain from a cheaply produced
animated series for teens but in part because of it
i think being pretty much a live cartoon character really
your
as a politician
you
iconic simple effective narrative
t even matter if you re a modern hero type of cartoon character or a caricatural villain from a
animated series
believe it or not surely a very large deep learning model trained on all the data should have the answer to everything is a position many people defend

never mind that current ai
have very close to zero flexibility and breadth today we are at the task specific
stage i e local generalization and will stay there until we directly tackle to question of engineering broad
cognitive

flexible and broad ai will come from a combination of

pattern recognition i see program synthesis and in particular genetic
as holding potential but really we should explore more
and many people are accordingly waiting for some kind of philosopher s stone or lamp genie of infinite intelligence and therefore infinite power they don t quite know how to create it but presumably all you need to do is figure out the correct series of

this is making it nearly impossible to have a conversion on this topic many people now think of intelligence as an intrinsic property of an algorithm synonymous with power over the world that can be
to reach arbitrarily high
like the height of a building
making progress towards more flexible ai
with generalizable
rather than specific
is definitely doable today but it does require
the scope of your research beyond pattern recognition
such as deep learning
it
to me that the
obstacle to making progress towards ai of increasing flexibility
breadth up to some generality threshold is the fundamentally incorrect conceptualization of intelligence that is
by these
fi
which is now pervasive
the label
the way people use it does not mean artificial intelligence
with broad cognitive
applicable to a wide range of new
rather it

on the genie from
a omnipotent omniscient yet servile
benevolent entity
generality in ai which a matter of degree not an absolute is an v important problem yet strangely the people who say they work on
don t seem to be interested in understanding the problem of generality
instead focus on
task specific skill by scaling up

every paper that
your idea is a paper that does work you won t have to do so you can focus on the next step
intellectual maturity is
more about

progress than about flag planting
ultimately we don t care that much about
we care about

and music and

arc competition on
week two first non trivial

to the

and yet it s serious life saving research no thanks to cult like
who overpromise and

it s like working on blood testing research in a world where a secretive company
raised

to build a mysterious device that can test anything from a single blood drop in the mind of the public it s the only narrative they can think of when you bring up your research
the main reason i dislike this nonsense generality in artificial intelligence is a serious research topic with real

real
with both near term
long term progress to be made these ridiculous
fi
that shape public perception are an obstacle
but if computer science
it somehow all semblance of critical thinking goes away although these are not even fair
the cure to everything
the matter printer are much better defined it s clear what their
are and why they would be valuable
the material
equivalent we re working on a matter printer it could materialize any object in
purely from a data specification with any material it will make obsolete all of
with a
investment it may only be

away
the medical
equivalent we re working on
a formula that can cure everything
death it will upend life as we know it with a
investment it may only be

away
it s insane how uncritically many non technical people are
this nonsense i guess this really
the power of
a lot of money in

there s an invention that the scientific community is about to discover it s


in the future maybe less no one
what it is or what form it will take or what its
will be one thing is certain getting it will mean an instant
trillion



now let s watch the slow descent to

that s a great use of
really curious how it will get

not so long ago the us political spectrum was center right

right
now it
to be left
far right strange evolution
i
you to have free will your
and your
control your
but then
the man how can i control my
and my
very simple it s your
that control the
you think and the way you feel
i always ask the same

it easy to compare
and they re very straightforward no particular knowledge
just the ability to program no

if the answer can be
or learned in one week on the job then it s a bad interview question you
train your people so hire for that which you can t train no

when
don t test for specialized knowledge or
that can be easily acquired best way to filter out good
test for broad

experience for the faculty to understand
solve a problem for

ways of thinking that take
to acquire
there s always a solution program the
are solvable not sure what you mean by mathematical map besides program
a competitor on

written solution
for the first

in the arc training set check it out now what you should look for is an algorithm capable of generating these
on its own
cellular automata which are a
for
over

should be able to solve some fraction of the
those where only local
are
you should give it a try note that

t
the challenge so you can participate no conflict of interest
ai is alchemy and the saying goes ora





so if that s your thing feel free to train a system on as much external data as you want to acquire core knowledge
personally i would simply recommend
what they look like in the context of arc it s all
on a grid straightforwardly computable
the only real use of training here is to learn core knowledge
i believe learning core knowledge
via a pattern recognition approach like deep learning
t the most effective way to acquire them but it is likely to be viable
don t get caught up in the
that more data will solve all of your
that s the deep learning way of thinking more data will have limited usefulness on arc
i see lots of people
about generating more data you can definitely encode some
in program form and use these
to generate
of new input output
you can do whatever you want however
regarding the arc challenge feasibility it is meant to be difficult and i don t expect it will be fully
in

but i know for a fact that it is partially approachable today
program synthesis i will be very disappointed if no one
better than


t we all doing too many
and trying to avoid the momentous what would you do if you had five
to live
i
t have to say it if you
t post a barrage of
about your work in my
for the nth time since i
the arc paper it s not healthy
in any case i really want to know that arc is not in any way an attempt go slight you or steal from you you are simply not a factor in the
i
said and thought over the last

not everything is about you
what
me though is that you simultaneously claim credit for arc and say that you profoundly disagree with every idea that arc is built upon in particular core knowledge it s not coherent it can t be both at the same time
i don t claim to have
it there s a long intellectual history behind arc which is
in the arc paper imagine
a
for
paper in
then
credit for every subsequent paper doing
for
you have more productive
to do
to be clear concept program discovery from
input
output

been around since the
in the context of
testing and since the
in the context of
ai it s a classic format in inductive
an entire tiny
of ai see
the


counting
was
by
as an innate core knowledge system
by
and non human
that s why it is featured in arc
you get

for each
this is especially true in the case of writing
of a kind that haven t been written
of times before however it s certainly true that there are common code
that can be learned and
with a text generation model this can be useful to an extent
i think
text generation
some potential to be helpful in code generation but very little what it does is interpolation pattern recognition but
is
abstraction and reasoning
also if you re curious why arc
the way it does where it comes from and what it
to work on
it you should check out this paper
i see

about the ending of neon genesis evangelion and i m like
if you want to use external data or hard code core knowledge
all of this is
virtually anything is
just get those

to go down
if you re not sure where to start on the arc competition here s my advice it s a very difficult challenge but i strongly believe with some evidence that someone smart

can develop in a few
an approach that


of the
in the hidden test set
if you use or want to use
with
please take a look at this proposal and give us your feedback
i hope this challenge will help the rise of alternative
to program synthesis that leverage human cognitive

focus on abstraction
generalization instead of the usual learn the manifold of the data
a dense sampling of it then do local interpolation
arc is a set of
like
that
don t reuse knowledge other than core knowledge basic set of knowledge
that even v young
possess
are readily solvable by
without training or

are out of reach for current ai or are they

in this setting it s hard to imagine
not getting

not now nor at further

it may seem like an incredibly obvious thing to say but a democratic nation that

to defend the rule of law or human
when
cannot possibly stay democratic for very long
some call it the unthinkable but it is very much thinkable throughout the world and since the dawn of history autocracy

i don t think there are

what
is that the overwhelming majority of the increase in

this is really interesting learning to generate cellular automata that yield specific

have
fast in the past

but wait for the next

you
know we

the next stage when a first opponent or
will be
and
on transparently false
and no one will protest
from where we are this should be in late
or early
after the

increasingly the power of the state will be used to smear silence or intimidate


literally the very first page of

glaring

a lot of x is making people stupid moral
boil down to people were stupid all along and x is making that painfully obvious
i believe it s mostly a and as such intelligence
happen under environmental change and require
evolution of brain body and social
many evolutionary
were
to create the
for the development of human intelligence
b there are inherent near universal evolutionary
in being
and as such most species with a complex brain are becoming
over time also curious whether there s any evidence that
or
or
are
today than

ago
which is truer a species with brains rarely become
over time because their cognition is already
with regard to their body
and environment they
t clearly benefit from a
brain with higher resource consumption continued
until the next big crisis in


when the mask will fall as it usually does
there will still be an opposition just increasingly marginal and increasingly
there will still be political criticism in the media just increasingly less
but overall everything will still look like business as usual
you
see
political
and anyone who
the leader getting

silenced via

on false
every job appointment in the
and at the top of large
will become political
by loyalty to the leader
to be clear i don t expect the us to become totalitarian overnight rather it will take a similar direction as russia in the
it
keep its constitution it
have
it
look mostly normal but the power of the state will start getting used against

the history lesson here is that you can t defend the rule of law purely via the rule of law
are ultimately made of people not

one important point is that a lot of the opposition in the past



of saying
is illegal with the implication it
t happen or
t stick almost invariably it did have you considered that it may not matter at all
the world
duly noted that the us is no longer a country of
the transition must have
at some point in the past

usually these
are hard to reverse and tend to accelerate over time expect the political

media censorship to start in

it s not

share a written summary

reminder we re
a
community meeting tomorrow

at

anyone can join the call
is if you have an announcement to make please
me and i
include it in the deck
for instance if you decide to send a notification
it should provide useful information and it should be worth your user s time it should not be a trick to get them to log back in to inflate

the most valuable thing is a good brand and a good brand is a trust relationship your
should trust that what you re doing in their best
the long term cost of

is immense
of course this
overall adoption and
but that s not even the most important motivation here the real reason to do this is trust
you should make your product as valuable as possible to your
even if it
reducing the need for your other
or reducing the time
spend in the product
the difference between a wish and a goal is
a path to get to your goal setting a target without a plan is just a wish
if your media
politics as a constant spectacle it s not surprising that politics would evolve into a literal reality show

meaning is contextual
modeling the statistical structure of language absent any context is a bit like modeling the latent space of all airplane
it will enable you to generate new realistic airplane
via interpolation but it
the purpose
the
context of this interface
the common thread here is that language is always an interface the study of language only
sense in the context of the relationship between an agent and its environment
other
an agent and itself or many
as a collective
language as operating system for the mind a tool to formulate complex
to store
index
retrieve
or
language as artistic medium poetry
language as
for society
civilization tool to store and propagate knowledge culture
so what are the
of language on top of my head language as communication channel receive and convey information about the world language as
saying something action towards a goal language as social lubricant chitchat

after the release of

i m looking forward to seeing ai
that have a model of the world assume
do too use some form of language to update
on each side as well as many

you use language for it
t matter if their syntax is terrible
statistical mimicry is to language what a plastic toy
a bus is to public transportation innovation it may look right but it can t perform its function a horse drawn cart would be
but could actually move people from a to b it s cargo cult ai
if an algorithm

natural language i would expect it to be able to do some of the
language is for communicating information

machine learning is about fitting to a static distribution human learning is about gathering knowledge that may turn out to be useful in a future that is
to share little commonality with the past
in fact every single of our days is completely unique unlike any day we
experienced before and unlike any day experienced by anyone since the dawn of humanity and somehow we can still cope that s the point of general intelligence extreme generalization
it would be very convenient though mind numbingly boring if the content of our days was just a simple interpolation of
we had experienced
of times before we could train a deep learning model to replace us


a powerful set of machine perception
that until recently
t exist utilize them much like
in the


it s not there to replace you it s there to help you do your job better and at an
scale
honestly the question is not and
never been can machine learning replace

which won t happen in the foreseeable future the question is how can radiology
utilize
to improve
decrease the cost of care and broaden accessibility
of course interpolation
pattern recognition are nevertheless a fundamental component of intelligence just not the most powerful being able to do it well by refining deep learning is immensely valuable
in the future ai will be capable of extrapolation not just interpolation i e broad generalization
further general intelligence this is an endeavor entirely orthogonal to interpolation curve fitting which will be
through an entirely different set of

as such
to study generalization by fitting
to random data is a category error since such data
no possibility of generalization to understand generalization you must look at the relationship between
and natural data

as far as current machine learning is concerned generalization
from the ability to learn the latent manifold on which the training data
i e the ability to interpolate between training
local generalization by definition
i see too many people taking the stance
does not magically solve every problem therefore we
t use it instead
in every industry should be
what can i do with
while keeping in mind its
turns out there s a lot you can do
sure our
have close to no intelligence they re just
what we
trained them to do but that power
them extremely useful in the real world just not a panacea

machine learning because it can t make sense of what it
t seen before it quite short sighted it is immensely valuable to be able to automatically recognize what you are able to label especially on hard pattern recognition
at super human accuracy
i don t get why i am forced by the
to give a wide public platform to these
being away from twitter was psychologically freeing no daily
no constant influx of gross ignorance and stupidity and
being mad at what they imagine other people are like
the great thing about twitter is that you can read live
from interesting people the terrible thing is that any random troll can them their brain

can choose who to follow they should also be also to disable
from people they don t follow
i d been away from twitter for

not by choice
again today and the stupidity aggressiveness and meanness feel overwhelming maybe
away is the wiser option
it is more important to have greatly extended the
of the
spirit than the
of the
empire
about

that is until the model
something it
t quite seen before hence the need to keep
in the loop
reading

is incredibly hard i have no doubt that with sufficient training data deep learning will eventually be better at it than trained

life is extremely fragile it s too easy to take good health for

the resource intensiveness naturally comes from the lack of adaptability you need to plan for every possible unknown whether explicitly or via a dense sampling of possible
assuming a fixed distribution
intelligence is adaption to unknown
across an unknown range of
and

is at best robustly handling known
over known
which is already incredibly difficult and resource intensive in the real world whether engineering or data
if the cartoon is drawn with sufficient realism and
sufficiently many
what s the difference you may ask adaptability to the unknown a
will autonomously adapt to a
future an automaton will perform the
you
for
cognitive
is incredibly useful but autonomous abstraction generation is a different creature altogether as new
are to animated cartoon
whether the cartoon character is
by hand or
via example
the second form is especially powerful since
implicit
only via
training
is far more practical and versatile than explicitly

by hand for all
of historically difficult

cognitive
can happen via explicitly hard
human


or via
a dense sampling of

and training some flavor of locality sensitive
on it such as a deep learning model
our field

the
and
of human



the intelligence label is a category error

well deserved
this could be
as the true test of a scientific idea is contact with reality and impact on the world not approval by other
and if academic
are the only hurdle your
ever have to clear it may be that you

i believe the goal of a research field should be to stop being primarily a research field and instead move into the real world become an industry deep learning

this is now as far in the past as
is in the future
when people make
about the future it s a lot more informative about their own
of interest
and knowledge
than about the future
there can be no intelligence without learning simultaneously learning is not a sufficient condition for intelligence and crucially intelligence fundamentally
from curve fitting a formal definition
a rigorous framework for thinking about these

one of the
of
an explicit formal definition of intelligence is to identify what general
underpin it a precise definition and measure serve a north star for research
the definition from the statement below is accurate
our past up to this point is certainly a fertile ground to plant it
happy new year to everyone may
be the seed of a wonderful future for you for our species and for our planet
looking forward to seeing how

a while ago i thought doing
in a clever way was cool now i understand that simple is better than clever clever is mostly showing off
two more
then


which
in general no please don t share private

i will always listen to reasonable
and then make up my own mind
i have done my very best to trace the genealogy of every important idea in my own paper and cite it i have

in addition my paper was
by several
before release who
various
which i almost all added none
your paper

it
an important idea method tool that your work
attribution
it
a direct competitive alternative to your proposal which the reader should be made aware of
it
a reference survey that the reader can use to learn more about a topic
as i
you don t cite
based on topic similarity or tool overlap if i write a
for
paper once it
t mean every subsequent
for
paper must cite it despite significant
overlap you cite
for one of three

i hope this clear
up and i hope you will be more friendly in your attitude in the future i did my best to be nice to you so far seemingly to little avail
the test format that you consider to be a huge similarity between our works is a super common test format that
been in use in

and in the field of program synthesis for
if you had
it i would absolutely have
you
i do not cite every single paper that
ever

of intelligence i cite those that are either
reference

that
key
that i use
that offer direct
to my definition of intelligence or to arc that s how it works
you don t just cite
because they share one or two vague
which would involve

of
of paper in every paper you cite
either for attribution or because they would constitute a useful reference for the reader to check out
and it never
to me to cite your paper because it
t a relevant citation it
t constitute a reference survey it did not originate any key idea that my paper
and it does not offer a direct alternative to any of the

my paper
arc

you keep
me of plagiarism
arc was near
before your paper was
i
working on it in late
i took exactly nothing from your paper which i vaguely skimmed after you sent it to me which you did after i had
to you about arc
i you have any interest at all in formally
intelligence instead of vague
i suggest you read this paper
no it
t what
the
year old intelligent is its ability to acquire new
solve new
it s irrelevant who what
the
year old it s her generality that
her intelligent a task specific program is not intelligent because it
no generality
the single biggest misconception in ai is the confusion b t unintelligent output
skill

the process that
them artificial intelligence
been
purely on task specific
entirely
intelligence time to change that
a task specific solution program
no intelligence of its own it s merely the output artifact of the process of intelligence intelligence is what
in the mind of the
year old
who looking at a new task
it and
a solution protocol
yet there s currently no program that can solve a new arc task such a program would be an incredible breakthrough in artificial intelligence the ability to look at a new arc task and come up with a solution program is as of yet uniquely human
for any task in arc it s possible for a human to write a reasonably short computer program that can handle new
everything is straightforwardly computable unlike say


there s no human advantage in any single task
help
whenever you can don t expect anything in return
can only hurt you if someone
you be grateful for it
i think we tend to overestimate the importance of reciprocity a transactional
and underestimate the power of kindness even the

of kindness can change
none of the most important
in life are transactional
take care of yourself and work purposefully
greatness is much more about inspiration and quality than about quantity and intensity intensity is only a net positive if you already know exactly what you re supposed to be

you can definitely do great work without
to sacrifice other
of your life in fact in many

a
life outside of work is a requirement in order to do great work
i would add that our current understanding and usage of modern deep learning its genealogy
mostly in
modern machine learning
not in
the influence of

been one of high level conceptual inspiration not direct emulation
however my gut feeling is that the brain is generally not
although some
could be
as
or part
e g the visual cortex is a deep hierarchy of
albeit not all are learned and
been a considerable source of inspiration in

the only good answer here the brain is an incredibly complex thing
many
that are structured differently and we know extremely little about it we cannot definitely answer the question
so deep learning is the idea of doing representation learning via a chain of learned feature
it s all about
some input data via deep
of
where
are learned a further question is then is the brain deep learning
these are two entirely different
on data manipulation deep learning
t just end to end gradient descent but not every program is deep learning either in fact deep learning
only
a tiny tiny slice of program space it can t hurt to look beyond it
so
is a fundamentally different beast from symbol manipulation and regular
which is fundamentally discrete flow centric and
t usually involve intermediate data
you could do symbol manipulation with
but it
lots of extra

by definition deep learning is a gradual incremental way to extract
from data in its modern incarnation it s even at least
continuous more typically c
that last part

it does not prescribe a specific learning mechanism e g

this
in contrast to

that are not representation learning e g manual feature engineering like sift symbolic ai

shallow learning where there is a single feature extraction layer
deep learning
to an approach to representation learning where your model is a chain of
typically a stack pyramid hence the notion of depth each of which could serve as a
feature extractor if trained as such that s also how i define it in my book
if you have a
and you train its
with
is that no longer deep learning is an
model with learned
not deep learning is a deep neural network trained greedily layer by layer not deep learning i say they re all deep learning

overly restrictive to me it

our world is pretty strange as it is but many of its potential
are far stranger
you can outperform in pretty much any craft by

and ways of thinking to generate knowledge

that have potency over reality it s relevant to many
that may not quite look like science

simply

of service
reading well

like reading a concise clearly articulated essay it s a joy meanwhile reading convoluted laborious code
like reading an incoherent rant

useful for
new information i have used it a lot in the past especially in college
i would rather exchange long
with interesting people than have a beer with them

from confused mental

where deference to authority is paramount i mean it s actually illegal to cross the street in
and people take that rule very seriously
stationary bike shedding

what everyone is so
on the big piles of nonlinear
trained with gradient descent is just an implementation detail in the background
this new interface
two
data collection
annotation
on one hand and loss function engineering on the other hand a way to specify the
you want to encode and what you need to do with them
machine learning is fundamentally a

innovation much like

mice or

a new interface between what people want and the production of computer
that implement it a new medium
not a fan of automatic differentiation
it s so derivative i like small batch
gradient descent

are perhaps one of the best
of this dynamic
line count complexity good code is simple code it s findable readable understandable modifiable and testable very concise code or worse clever code often
against these

there are a few more as well i think a system can be said to be capable of language understanding if it can use language to perform at least one of these
preferably all three naturally all of these require strong
of external grounding

language as operating system for thinking even in the absence of other
or an environment to effect people use language to

structure their
perhaps the most interesting function of language
a way of generating
language


language as
language is used by people to achieve some immediate effect on their surroundings just like any other motor action
an environment as well as
intentionality

but in particular
language as communication language is used to transfer mental

because they have access to modern technology but technology

what

is that it made it too easy to be tacky good art is hard work it s easier not to make

remember when trump was trying to buy
and
this
it was

ago
you could say that modern civilization is a chaotic system due to its numerous feedback
and incredible complexity relatively small
can have large ripple effects and climate change is a very large
we simply don t know how the system will react
it will have to move towards a new equilibrium state and we might not like what s in it
that s the thing about climate change it will require adaptation of a large magnitude over a short time span the human species will do fine we are incredibly adaptable it s civilization i m worried about it
on a fragile network of millions of interdependent

the fast way forward
being critical being pragmatic not
and not drinking the
aid
i think the more excited you are about the future potential of ai the more realistic you should be about its current
because it s only by facing reality as what it is that we can make progress

do this for machine readable
e g a compiler reading a

fair but consider that i
been writing about
for
before i

back when i had no idea i would ever join
and if i were to leave the company tomorrow it would not change my opinion one bit
perhaps with different leadership and a completely different company culture
could even be a good product but as it
now it is not compatible with liberal democracy and one of the two will have to give
i
said this many times before but the problem
t social media as a product category and it
t
as a business model the problem is
itself its deeply toxic leadership and its deeply toxic social and political impact
to all of western society and liberal democracy

machine learning to check still there

don t like to linger in dreamland for too long invite your

respect for all of you

some python experience and high school math like my book it should be a great fit
woohoo look what i got in the mail s new book very comprehensive resource to learn machine learning over

it
clear detailed
written by someone with a lot of experience and

a great one for sure
like a spark in the wind

may seem confused obscure downright absurd but only in dream do we see clearly absent the mediation of the
absent the oppressive weight of reality the best fiction should aspire to a dreamlike quality through which truth may finally shine for a brief instant
you re just mad because you
t think of raising

while you could
a neat finding
and
remain the most popular
for deep learning for classical machine learning it s
learn and

lots of great
about the global data science
machine learning industry in this survey by check it out
more people in the deep learning community should be aware of these
of the
they work on it may be a good time to start a
of the


involved to be used to exclude them from

unlike
i don t believe there is any essential difference between biological information

and silicon based information

the current gap is really functional and will be closed eventually albeit we are extremely far from it
crucially the generation of autonomous abstraction is largely orthogonal to the


of
human
as seen in current ai
much like
cartoon
is orthogonal to
new
ai
yet to get

ai is to human cognitive
what cartoon
are to human

ai is effectively a cognitive cartoon superficially it
like it s alive but it s really a sequence of crude
on paper that emulate human
behavior as such a project like sophia the robot is really the epitome of contemporary ai
ai is tricky it
exactly the narrow set of human
it is explicitly designed or trained to emulate and none of the
in doing so it
every available

a system that
essentially no common ground with the human mind
pretty much everything wrong about our perception of ai
among both
and the general public
down to excessive anthropomorphism

idea generating

this is true one step further all progress
from going back to the

your
accordingly so the
way to make progress is to be constantly trying to prove yourself wrong constantly be looking up
that might invalidate your


some of the

the only criterion for task viability is whether
seem to be able to solve it without
non core knowledge

down the wall

rely on an explicitly defined set of cognitive

in the paper you could hard code these
or you could learn them from the training set or a mix of both the
are assumed they re not what the
is testing
i devote a lot of space in the paper to explain why
functional
is not conducive to effective progress a good working definition should also be explanatory
hi
if the point is that input output pair concept discovery is prior art for arc then the relevant
are the past

of psychometric testing it s also a classic program synthesis problem format as
in the paper

we
run a public competition on the
which should provide concrete
to this question
of course it was typeset in latex i mean the
source is literally available for
from
weird reply

fun fact the name

from

the
from book
of the

which is what i m working on now this is fundamentally what arc is about
i think
got a number of
right especially given the context at the time this was mostly designed in
with an attempt to implement a simplification of it in
but ultimately it did not touch the most essential point the nature of abstraction


may remember it because i did my best to explain it to him in
i won t the other person
the
was cognition is a dynamic hierarchical modular map of the space of sensorimotor information i also
it map theory there are perhaps two people in the world who will remember me preaching about it around




from a classic

and centered on
learning modular hierarchical
of spatiotemporal


matrix factorization as opposed to gradient descent
context switching via a form of attention and
intrinsic motivation curiosity
the theory
been in the making since
it
significant
from project
open ended
electronic intelligent robot operating system which was a general ai architecture i worked on from
to
then again briefly in
then mostly abandoned
lately i
made good progress on an algorithm that is capable of
at least part of arc based on a theory of cognition autonomous abstraction that i
been working on for a long time i hope to be able to share these

code soon
i want to emphasize that the definition provided here
t meant to be the one true definition that s not the point intelligence is complex and may be different
in different
many possible
of intelligence or ai can be valid
this definition is my attempt to formalize
i
been talking about for the past

in

on twitter into something useful and actionable arc itself
led me towards very interesting research
and i hope you will find it useful too
the paper

a discussion of the history of how we
defined and
ai so far
a new formal definition of intelligence concrete
for what a general ai
should look like

of arc and the logic behind it

get so emotional about it a religion that

transformer library in


this is relevant to anyone doing deep learning for natural language

this is great hope twitter will invest extra effort into blocking propaganda bot
as well
perhaps
is not what you think it is
from
abstraction to cognitive augmentation
to autonomous abstraction
historically we went technology to record sound to technology capable of helping with music production and creation new more powerful
eventually we will see open ended autonomous music creation this will be the trajectory of ai as well
don t confuse music creation with sound recording
are the origin of music unlike a phonograph they can play a never
before score or write never
before music or take up a new instrument or invent a new musical genre
ai today is to human intelligence what the phonograph was to human
superficially it may seem like it
a comparable output
is ready to replace
which was a real fear back then but it
radically different
it s merely a recording device
if ai today
t capable of autonomous abstraction it
t because it s a particularly hard technical problem rather it s a subtle conceptual problem it
t seem like many people are looking at it you can t produce the right
if you re
the wrong

all generalization must by definition come from some form of abstraction the
that can be learned by

often
of human

via
are fairly weak and shallow which is why
is only capable of local generalization
a way to describe intelligence is that it is the power to produce abstraction ai in the true sense would be autonomous abstraction current ai
of recording

by the human mind via hard

training

on human
data

to be clear this
t because the human mind is some kind of sacred mystery intelligence can be rigorously defined and measured but when you do it you realize that none of what we
built so far is actually intelligent so far at least we will get to it eventually
artificial intelligence is a very bold label in practice i have yet to come across any technique at all that
even trace
of intelligence
perhaps a great opportunity to use s


transformer

first of all it s practice for problem
it also
you more familiar with the crux of the problem as well as
you might otherwise be missing you will find it much easier to understand other

after thinking about the problem for a while
there s a big difference between learning to solve
and learning to look up

when approaching a new problem it s good to make a serious attempt at
it yourself from scratch
the wheel if necessary before looking up best

i have no studied it but here s my take on it from a few
ago
one thing i
been
with lately
where the more abstract form of a program which can handle more
is simpler then a version that s specialized for one case or subset of
what are some cool
you
seen
the nature and purpose of
is to be a well
conduit for extremist propaganda hate
fear
engagement their endorsement of
is entirely consistent with the state of the product and business model


and fox news
that s why education and journalism besides political infrastructure such as institutional
and
are critical failure of either of those
inevitably
to democratic decline by the time you notice it
are already pretty bad
democracy and civic

t a stable end state their continued existence
buy in and support from a majority of
when
no longer care the
of democracy will start rolling it all back
i hear their basilisk is good
climate change is not a political issue for
of the world by population that s only the case for a tiny geographical and cultural slice of the world
it is well known that the only way to ship any
project is to redefine completion down in order to by pass the time to completion singularity
this is premium actually content i fully agree that there is strong empirical evidence from

that
time
go up monotonously as the project
and may diverge to infinity when the project is the
to completion

my own singularity prediction i predict that in

will be forecasting the singularity for


why this number

would be too close and too relatable you may have personal

career
or get the

would be too distant and irrelevant you d be very old perhaps dead but


the

people nowadays seem more likely to quote
the common point among these
they re always

this task only
a very weak form of language understanding and can be
while only
a very small amount of actual intelligence this is extremely far from human intelligence
this is dramatically different from general intelligence and much

this poll is about how people perceive
progress at this time don t see it as a way to actually predict the future people s
are always wrong
given the recent progress trajectory of
and my natural optimism i think something like this is probably


away
imagine an algorithm capable of generating a
like encyclopedia from raw
e g from the
minus
at the same level of factual accuracy edition quality scope and resolution when will this be feasible
in the long term trust is the only currency any sort of misrepresentation of reality
the trust of those who can see it for what it is it should be pretty basic stuff know your audience
it
very little to the long term success of your lab company whether someone s uncle
we re close to strong ai because he read it in the newspaper but it
a lot what other
in the field think about you
what those who
ai and mislead the public about their
need to understand is that they re ultimately compromising their own credibility

to make this work at all you have to carefully tune your learning rat

every new generation is even more extremely
than the previous one
in ten
will just live in a symbiotic relationship with their phone pretty much
i use a retractable cognitive tape measure


still a much higher cognitive overhead for me
to my native language i
learning at
cognitive specialization in early
is real
for most all people who suffer from depression it is not a choice
the audience you are trying to reach and the
you use say a lot about what you do if you publish in


you re likely doing research if instead your primary goal is to get media coverage you might be in the entertainment business
your
don t need to be a cabal of hyper competent
in order to hijack your
they just need to play the role of nominally competent
because you
already given them a massive pile of critical
to play with
and once you
discovered a cheap and potent vector of attack and your opponent is slow to patch it of course you are going to exploit it to its full potential
the world over should be on high alert for the next few
it s not just
it s not just the us
i read somewhere that
don t break
they merely demonstrate that the system was broken all along this is true for democracy too
turns out hacking both computer
and political
is a very high roi vector of attack cheap and potent because you are
your opponent s
hidden
which are plenty and entirely by passing its

if there is no solution you have a

complicated
call for complicated
complicated
do not generalize and rarely scale
prefer working on simple abstract
specifically on the simpler more abstract version of your problem
if you are not making progress on a solution look for new

the solution must be

with the problem or more precisely with our understanding of the problem
new nuclear
are tested exclusively in simulation
are
maybe the next generation will use
after that the post
model will be trained on real world data
working on data efficiency typically
finding new
to increase the amount of information we can extract from the same data but information efficiency is an entirely unrelated concept how to efficiently and effectively make use of information
the difference between data
information data is plentiful
noisy the large majority of data is not information information is what
data useful we are bad at

from data we only manage to distill
use a small fraction of what is really available
twitter is the only
social
whose

t grown in the last few
and there are clear
why
abstraction is the golden path to information efficiency but all
of
can get you data efficiency
there s a big difference between data efficiency and information efficiency we could make considerable progress on the former without even starting to approach the latter and never realize our fundamental mistake
nice i
been waiting for your game for many
can t wait to play
this is correct also if you are a
employee remember that you re not mark you don t have to reflexively believe or publicly endorse the latest morally bankrupt official position of your employer take the time to reflect on right
wrong independently of your affiliation

in almost a decade on

education which are also critical it
short term

one of the most effective
a government can do to foster an ecosystem of ai
is to have a national open data strategy put all government data behind

why the

in conclusion if you ever wonder where something comes from the answer is usually from

meanwhile china
the word

with basically the same meaning pronounced
in
which transferred to
as
did the
word come from the


word which itself came from
can t say for sure but it
likely
it turns out that the
word had previously made its way into

and from there to
and
it may have travelled as far east as
and that s the word the
brought back like genealogy etymology
t a tree it s a graph


comes from

strong wind itself from ancient


it
the

who got it from south

i had always assumed that the similarity between the
word for typhoon
pronounced
and the

was accidental but is it this word turns out to have a strange thousand year history
it s mostly true that the space of

i
also been seeing since before

that

they overlap greatly people move from one to the
and they benefit each other at the end of the day if they can stay relevant
i
been


adoption metrics for a long time that s what you do when you create
you track adoption if you
been listening to me i
also been saying since forever that the existence of multiple

cross pollination are good for

there is no doubt that competition and the availability of multiple
are good for the end user and crucially for
it s not a either or choice between the different

so don t believe the fud it s typically just a marketing ploy to drive a message conflict
i suppose
and what they use now may not be what they use in

this is especially true in research where each project
from scratch and



for production
there is more of a need to settle on one framework and accrete
over time
i think the notion that there s a deep learning framework war raging is pretty mistaken it s not like there are different
that don t talk to each other the majority of people use multiple
often within the same project
as for why it s

academic research is also literally the only usage category where you will see high

above

the actual split in the research world is

all the
i can think of end up in this range extremely dishonest article

that s what the data

it s hard to imagine another context in which

real
guess you must be

freedom of speech so much it
every social media
it
t directly control the
is on the wrong side of history and everyone in the world can see it clearly
you can t just hope that
will spontaneously become more reasonable if you start appeasing them it s the exact opposite they will see you as weak and they will keep
the same playbook on a
scale
the thing with
is this they don t respect any
or
they only respect power everything they do is a trial balloon if it works they take it as a sign that they can keep pushing further they won t take a step back until they encounter real resistance
i think if you do have freedom of speech you should use it and sometimes you should use it on behalf of those who don t have the same privilege
to
when your safety is not at stake is pretty cowardly

some kind of gift themselves be it a merch store a supplement or a
it s
all the way down
we all have
that

through

to put it more abstractly most of what we apply ai to is cultural in nature and ai research and
are now starting to be mature enough that they re
cultural

in particular the lack of

and
from the next generation of ai

like mandarin will probably be fine but those with small

one of my
about current
in ai research is the reinforcement of the long term cultural
linguistic dominance of the

is the exclusive language of research which

sometimes about something i said or did i want to tell them you don t need to be mad all the time you don t need to attack
