version
disjunction
in



there are
like those lovely
that elevate disjunction from being just another top down
art stealth game with

to something a little more and it s really quite good
the other major innovation of
is to allow data dependent dynamic compute

history are we
i think it s pretty much all representation learning more precisely it s all about learning world
and the main issue with that is how to represent multimodality in the prediction because the world is not entirely predictable
there is exactly zero credible evidence for the existence of any god that
t stop humanity from

of them all of them are false almost all of them demonstrably so

but are they all as intellectually giant as you
i hope it
their connection with science science unlike a
creator is based on evidence and actually


technological progress

some
disappear many new
are
a very large number of
people have today
t exist

ago
i could not agree more
you are not wrong
in
days
for
ai already
a huge positive impact on society filtering objectionable content

traffic
with emergency automatic



and other
in medical
ai


sad to see that only
of the
population
ai and
as being good for society it is very
to see the worst in everything but one can t miss out on the next industrial revolution thankfully young people are much more positive than their

they just like
stuff occasionally obvious stuff
when you act in ways that result in the avoidable death of

people or the near destruction of a long established democracy you have to be either stupid or evil or both
so tell us what s wrong with big tech and with what i said
even if the number is true there is the mistaken impression that this money would have to
exist and be taken away from something else but this would new economic activity which would create new wealth not consume it in addition to keeping the planet livable
which they briefly
freedom

and that s largely because there is no politically relevant group of

because there never were much immigration from
into the us
lots of

available as part of a project on machine learning for climate modeling at



excellent interview of my friend

candela tech lead for responsible ai at
he also
a bit his previous role as lead of applied
when we worked together a lot good text summary

substantial evidence and


also the
right will not miss an opportunity for


on the contrary

and
on democracy must be exposed and

either ted
seriously
that the
climate agreement was written for the benefit of
or he
his
are stupid enough to believe that i m quite sure it s the latter he is not stupid he is just evil
it is terrifying even for seasoned
like us but one must appreciate the fact that an inaugural lecture at
is a sufficiently important event of cultural life in
to provoke media attention


t take long

lush is the version of
x that we
to open source in late

hey no
thanks for the

the original idea of
on
is from
pereira our innovation was to back propagate
through those
so as to perform end to end learning with structured prediction

was done in the

lisp interpreter

of

the

lisp compiler was
largely numerical code operating
the compiler was written mostly by

patrice
and a bit by me

stupidity ignorance lack of foresight callousness partisanship propaganda incompetence yes
the fiscal
that
with
s tax cut on high
is what
the

we see today in
not in
want a root cause for trump s election that s it here is another graph for from

something about self
learning but it s actually quite a hot topic at the moment
well socialist government research
laid the groundwork for the vaccine before it was worth
a
to develop a product and
the distribution is failing because of a lack of socialist style government
not because of red tape
an opportunity for me to clarify a possible confusion
by
people had stopped being interested in neural net and in end to end training which included what was later
structured prediction and even later latent variable energy based

definitely not enough of that either and wine



with
self loathing because there
t enough of something good and

confusion here graph transformer

it s also that absolutely everything

that s probably the marginal cost the total cost

yeah it s pretty atrocious you are given a long list of

disjunction a

art stealth action
by ape tribe
is coming out on

for
steam

one

switch why am i posting this those great
are close to my heart
well
is very different now than

ago
is no longer based on engagement
are gone because
can no longer promote their own content

of hate speech is taken down automatically in many
more emphasis on

this protocol is practiced in scientific
that tend to be a lot longer than

i would advise everyone to not view a tweet as a scientific publication
i got it here
go for it




the ability of the
government to use
to incite violence against its own population was fixed i know it s disappointing but
cannot actually fix all the world s
though it does
a bunch of them by
people with each other
which is why the
nuclear program was a national one and the

it were largely
by the government only a whole country can make this kind of investment and only a public service under a democratic government can be
to run it safely
there are many many people inside
entire
who study the effects on society
work to eliminate or mitigate harm but post
independent academic
are still necessary which is why

this

academic researcher
have
up to conduct exactly this kind of study you can sign up too
here it is


out that a lot of anti
propaganda was
by sock puppet
about fashion and such but
by the government none of that can be done in one day sorry for the bad

this was fixed by


speaking

banning the
of some





to
to handle the volume

the world s best
translation system
building language independent hate speech detector
what evidence do you have that

tremendous amplification how would you know if
actually limited the spread of information from unreliable
which it actually does why would conspiracy
move to
if
was so favorable
there is a lot of that on
already limiting the spread of information from unreliable
even if they don t violate content
which would cause them to be taken down
what about the majority of the world in which

a positive role for popular
and democracy e g like the
spring why is it that
that limit or ban
have authoritarian

what
you think
actually
this type of content what actual data do you have on this
unlike

is pretty flat

and
completely
from
in

i m all for rational respectful discussion on the substance even if twitter
that difficult the question is not whether my tweet was
but whether is was incorrect but my
merely stated a fact and
a question the answer is entirely yours

like
lots of highly variable wind power no
to pick up the slack only fossil fuel
this is production in the graph average production of
is about the same as
despite the german population being

because

electricity and

electricity

the safety record of nuclear energy prod is astonishingly good the of
due to nuclear
is insignificant
to those
by air pollution from fossil fuel
coal
spew
of magnitude more radioactivity in the air than

tired word
wired turd
better phonetic inversion

does not have the legitimacy to be the arbiter of political truth this must be done by a diverse set of independent
fact

the press advocacy
you and me
a single company with
s footprint
on political truth is dangerous
this only
at
not
the point is that you will see

and
way more often than
unless you actively follow
but when your uncle
a
rant you might go to their page and click the angry

most small
have no other option than fossil fuel their

per
are through the roof
coal and fossil
would look even worse
from coal
cause countless early
from respiratory and cardiac
as well as cancer
have non trivial
of radioactivity
technologically a
problem but the politics of it is complicated
or the public is less vulnerable to right wing conspiracy

social media would be guilty if it
hate speech and
to violence but

that down which is why trump and the far right hate
so much

of hate speech is taken down automatically by ai



s propaganda would be
on
for

against hate speech and
to violence trump s

were
which is why he

so much
you would have to establish first that
actually
such

as this post
this top
are
people engage with the most click
comment
the top
by reach seen by the
number is very different people just react a lot to controversial
like
and trump
if we did would you believe the
it s best to have it done by independent
in


is very different now than it was in

in late

independent research to understand
and

i don t but one thing the us and the
have in common besides an insular superiority complex is an influential right wing propaganda machine in which


a major role
indeed electricity is twice as expensive in
as it is in

with
technology that is simply impossible you either need a

of production when there is little wind or sun nuclear or fossil or you need large scale energy storage technology such a technology does not exist current battery tech
t scale

and a few other
have favorable geography that

don t have that kind of geography

they are working on very applied stuff not much long term research

my sons are actually writing

yes and where would they get their top
if
from our
of
and
there would be

disappearing from the research scene we would know about it
the
project was actually much
than anything in the open research scene there was no open research on nuclear
also the goal of beating the
made it possible to motivate
like

to work on the project ai is very different today
no because they would have had to hire many of our top

certainly nowhere near the same level as

with the help of an international army of

infrastructure and
are not just open they are open source even the data center design is open if you are
to the difficulty of

data through

for that like privacy protection
those who understand that the us is not the only country in the world realize that a number of other
seem to have
said
and supply chain
the rest are
on the topic
yes why
and when darkness

yes they are definitely less
and more avoidable more avoidable because i still run
but have

less

there used to be a version of that joke about

industry standard
truth

no constant q transform

this high contrast edge in circular motion as a motion orthogonal to the edge
no they are not moving
definitely not fake unless you think all visual
are somehow fake it is very dangerous to think that when you brain can t find a consistent interpretation of a percept then the information in the percept is fake generally it s just a limitation of your brain
these



that are normally correlated in real life a high contrast edge in motion is strong evidence for motion orthogonal to the edge the pathway from retina to
is
by the circular motion of a high contrast yet barely visible edge


it s an inevitable consequence of efficient
of relevant information you must eliminate what you think is irrelevant information in most
if in real life two variable are very highly dependent your internal representation can eliminate one of them

about this idea from him at the

with

in

and what country is


few people say that wealth should be capped but
a more progressive taxation system as in the
that
investment income as much as income from productive work would be good

for hedge fund
and real estate
would help too
now moneyed

t mean all rich people there are ethical
socially progressive
then there are rich people who use their influence to skew
to their financial advantage think



many oil industry


when wealth
are too high the country become
by moneyed
the government works for those moneyed
not for the people they pass
that protect the
of said moneyed
that s pretty much exactly what
in the us
the ultimate denial of reality
that covid is a hoax while dying of it then again by dying you get rid of reality altogether

there are plenty
of left wing authoritarianism



the entire soviet bloc before the fall of the berlin wall the

trump is done for
both right wing authoritarianism is strongly correlated with racism and nationalism left wing authoritarianism
racism by class warfare both require ideological purity and must divide to rule by

tell me
you are riding a bike the bike

look at this character a explain how you recognize it as an a
can an orangutan a
a dog a cat have knowledge since they don t have language

is just one particular combination of loss function log
like architecture

with a distance on top and pick of positive and contrastive




no there are many many ways to do contrastive learning they differ by
the loss function
the architecture the form of the scoring function
the way you pick or generate good
and contrastive

you can have b and c without a e g

al













al



al

and several
between then and now
a
is a loss b
net is an architecture c contrastive learning is a general training paradigm to give good
to

and bad
to unobserved
those are independent
you can have c without a or b b without a or c

as much as we are
of this type of knowledge it
a tiny portion of our brains most of our knowledge is acquired in the first few
of life and is completely non linguistic we learn how the world works we learn intuitive physics and common sense
almost everything you learn you learn before you can speak or understand language we think of high level knowledge as the most important knowledge but the most important knowledge is what you learn in the first few
of life you learn how the world works


clearly
some
but it s pretty shallow and narrowly limited to knowledge that
been easily expressed in language the vast majority of human knowledge cannot be efficiently expressed through language

s voter registration campaign got

a think the term latent
model should designate
in which there is a free variable whose value or distribution is not directly
but determined through minimization
or sampling so generator is a
critic is not at least no usually
albeit a rather trivial one in which inference merely
in sampling from a
prior
i agree the critic formerly known as discriminator in a gan is actually an energy based model the generator is merely a smart way to generate suitable contrastive
whose energy will be
up the generator is a latent

been critical of my



i always
talking with

awesome paper
healthy discussion is what i was
for

the thing is i don t believe and i actually disagree on anything substantial
i really wish you could have a discussion with me and
from
ai about how we can work together to fight bias
i very much admire your work on ai ethics and fairness i care deeply about about working to make sure

get

sorry that the way i

that too i
done a lot of that as well

on a number of different


n
on a side note as it turns out harmful content is more pervasive on twitter than on
it s just that
is much bigger here is a recent study by the
union on how various social network
take down hate speech
there are several
at
that are entirely
on social impact of ai ai policy ai ethics and there are several research
within fair on these

m
of course we are already doing this but i m not leading anything at
i don t manage anyone i m the chief ai scientist i do fundamental research and advise research
on their research i have very little to do with content integrity and

m
but in the end the way to address the problem will have to go through one of the

in my list these are the control
that can be
upon regardless of whether the root
of bias are institutional racism lack of
diversity or whatever
the root
of
are many and some are due to the diversity of people involved in the
or lack thereof some to cultural
in society that we can t fix with a magic stroke

i agree
with everything you say in this thread my item
about deployment and the role of product
is precisely about this

the thread was obviously not just for
but for the people who read this exchange and who are not nearly as knowledgeable about these
as she is i learn
about
i m an expert in from
with much less experience than me like my
and

no i don t need any applause assumption of good intent would be nice though how can science and understanding progress if no one is
to explain their
as an
friend recently told me the engine of science is the celebration of constructive disagreement
not former i m a professor at
i share my time between
and fair
i know this paper please tell me which
of my

contradict any of the
of this paper
i suggest you ask all the
i have
with in my career
the
of these
at and the fair
working on these
are considerably more knowledgeable than i am on this perhaps you d be willing to engage with them if not with me
i m sad that you are not willing to discuss the substance i had hoped to learn something from this interaction there are several
at
that are entirely
on fairness bias and social impact of
ai there are many fair
on this too i
only one
see my long thread here
yes it s complicated but in many
the question as to whether a particular architecture regularizer loss
a specific societal bias is an empirical one
i did not say that generic
were free from bias i pretty much said the exact opposite i
whether common generic architecture log reg

have much built in societal bias they obviously have a lot of inductive bias
i don t assume bad intent from people and certainly not from i do wish people did the same with me
there
to be a lot of misunderstanding about this recent tweet of mine where i try to explain the cause of the bias seen in this work on face super resolution here is a long explanatory thread
to
it s also important to avoid assuming bad intent from your interlocutor it only
to inflame
to hurt people who could be helpful to mask the real
to delay the development of meaningful
and to delay meaningful action
n n

post
i think people like us should strive to discuss the substance of these
in a non emotional and rational manner it s hard sometimes but that s why we can call ourselves

n
the idea is to train an
system to be invariant to
on the proportion of
with
that are spuriously correlated with the desired output i find this very promising though clearly not the be all end all
n
another very new way to identify and minimize bias is the recent work on invariant risk minimization by

al

by my dear friend and colleague


n
my metaphor for this is if you go to medical school you don t spend time
the common flu and some rare disease in proportion to their
in
you spend comparatively more time on rare
because you need to develop the
for them
n
an easy way is to be aware of imbalance in the data and equalize the
of
from the various
i
been
this method for


this in its
system
n

the effect of bias in data can be done in a number of ways

have this peculiarity due the non convexity of the loss that they will not develop
for
of
that are rare this does not happen with logistic regression and such
n
now there can be much worse
of societal bias and more dire effects of societal bias in the deployment of the system this was the point of my comment about the relative importance of paying attention to bias in development and deployment versus research
n
so in modern

working from raw input no hand

with generic

and
the main source of bias will be in the training data the point of my tweet was that this is the case for the face super
work in question
n
concerning
the objective can be
of course but again one may ask whether a generic objective like mean squared error
built in societal bias my guess is not much but again i m ready to change opinion in front of evidence to the contrary
n
but one may ask whether modern generic model
like logistic regression fully connected neural
or
have significant intrinsic built in societal
my guess is no i m ready to change my opinion in front of theoretical or empirical evidence
n
concerning
the architecture of the model regularizer included must have at least some level of inductive bias owing to no free lunch
and that bias could very well cause societal bias in the result too
n
now if you use someone else s
trained model as a feature extractor your
will contain the
of that system as correctly pointed out in a comment to my tweet
n
that was
n when you use raw
with no hand

as is common in modern
system
becomes a considerably less important source of designer
bias e g modern image

work directly from
and generative
produce raw

n
there are many
for societal bias in

not talking about the more general inductive bias here
the data how it s collected and

the
how they are designed
the architecture of the model
the objective function
how it s

i m making the point that in the particular case of this specific work the bias clearly comes from the data
n
if i had
to reduce

by
to
bias i would have said

are
only when data is
but i m absolutely not making that reduction
n


ago most

used hand

which are a primary cause of bias but nowadays people use generic

fed with raw
greatly reducing bias from feature and architecture design this leaves us with data as the primary source of bias
indeed there are many possible
of bias
data collection feature design loss function architecture my point is that for generic


that learn from raw
no hand designed
the bias is much more likely to be in the data
sure but choosing between logistic reg fully connected net or
working from
will not cause the system to be intrinsically
towards people of certain
now the moment you hand design
you introduce bias and the data can obviously be

that s precisely my point
i was not talking about
theory style inductive bias which is data independent i was talking about garden variety everyday bias in

which is either in the
or in the data but if
are learned as in

t bias largely in the data
and training with
instead of
will not even begin to solve the problem
where when have i dismiss the harm
by the
community i m pointing out the cause of the harm so it can be fixed you can t fix the harm unless you know what
it no
as i point out in my comment to this tweet it s much more efficient to correct this kind of bias by equalizing the
of
of
during training than be hacking the loss function
i don t disagree with you here and i don t think my tweet
your statement
indeed that s why i wrote
without any reference to skin color
gradient descent is not invariant to
in
so no but that s precisely why
should be
to have zero mean and standardized variance if

t mean
just map the most frequent value to zero
the most efficient way to do it though is to equalize the
of
of
during training this
the network to pay attention to all the relevant
for all the sample

it will work just as well a more interesting experiment is the one in the invariant risk minimization paper
because people should be aware of this problem and know its cause so they can fix it
not so much

but

the
of bias are considerably more dire in a
product than in an academic paper
why is
statistics homeless and sad about it because it s
and
be



are
when data is
this face
system
everyone look white because the network was
on
which mainly
white people
train the exact same system on a
from
and everyone will look



but what do i know about

the
call it

and they even have leaves
it
to be a disease of right wing



i m a scare
scientist and i have high bias and presumably low variance
i m a scare
scientist with high bias does that mean i have low variance

is not
this indeed fascist regime

to organize themselves without

still
yes i m trying to be a decent person you just have the wrong idea about

even if the platform can also be used by people we oppose the

are quick to shut down

so that no one can accuse them of being fake news

covid
at
national lab
a new account about the better than you think reality of
today
by a young
ai scientist in the us
because you could freely intersperse lisp and c in the same function
in lush was often a mixture of lisp and c
yes lush was a lisp interpreter compiler with a tensor engine back end it was all written in c there were some
of

assembly magic for the dynamic loader the lisp compiler produced c that was
with
and dynamically loaded into the interpreter
a
post is like a tutorial or an
you explain
in simple
to a non specialist audience
some well known
and you only cite the most relevant prior work every
post is like that just read the actual paper
i wish something innovative like this could take off but people just want python and its ecosystem despite the obvious
of the language so people at
are just trying to fix the main
compiler to accelerate the juicy
removing global interpreter lock


i don t think they
to me particularly but the emergence of deep learning and the usefulness of differentiable
was too overwhelming to ignore
yes i
seen
it s cool it
a similar flavor to the lisp system

and i built as a front end for our neural net simulator back in
it was eventually open
under name lush and used actively until the early

we had a
simulator in c with lisp as the front end language we
efficient convolution
to train
manually unrolled
in
was the best way to reduce memory
and
out the
performance on sun


it s slow verbose
no particular advantage or functionality over c and totally
for numerical stuff i
t see the point other than the run everywhere securely thing which i never
about
it think a
language should have minimal
overhead and
pretty much
out running on top of the


again how many
encode tree
at the input and output of a neural network there are a few they do it differently and they are appropriately
in the paper but again this is not the main innovation in this paper and it s not
as such
and incompetence
i agree strangely a surprisingly large number of people blame
for not wanting to play the role of minister of truth

down egregiously harmful misinformation but it
t see itself

the legitimacy to become the arbiter of truth

widely
does not mean causally correct the media need a scapegoat and
is a perfect one they don t like
because they perceive it as eating their lunch
i think the blame should be
on the
of misinformation like say





a lot of energy fighting harmful misinformation
but

t have the legitimacy to be the arbiter of truth so it will only take down the most dangerous misinformation
even then it s really hard to do this automatically and reliably


this was initially
in c on an

with no
then i
to
and ported it to
with graphics and such that s what i used to implement the first

i had previously written a
simulator whose front end
language was turning into a
complete monster so i told myself why reinvent a language i thought about forth but settled on lisp then i met
who
the core interpreter in c in


i did a bit of
assembly
it

and
to implement fast
at bell
i do
hacking
which occasionally but rarely
arm assembly
what i like about lisp is not necessarily that it s functional but the fact that it s a

language where code is manipulable data
i know
it s cool some

worked at
and
i had a chat with some of them way back i told them they should have a tensor data structure similar to torch and should think about automatic differentiation but the sad thing is people just want to use python
knowing a lot of knowing a lot of
of
but really i just like

perturbation
like policy gradient in
are a kind of radiant descent
yeah well the lisp i used between
and
was one that

and i wrote initially as a front end to a deep learning simulator so that lisp itself

s rule

no
and their
version
polish notation are so standard as to not require citation but
that to represent the input and output of a
transformer neural net is somewhat new though
all
in the paper have done similar

working on a death star
is not research but product development
is designed solely to kill people hence ethically questionable but working on high power
could also enable fusion power and solve a whole bunch planet scale

agreed that s pretty much what ethics is all about but we have no legitimacy to impose our ethical
on society except through the regular democratic process i sure don t want anyone to impose their morals on me other than through the democratic process


yes it s

that have a
democracy it generally
t work in
that have a corrupt system or no democracy
with a
democracy put strong

not so much
time is of the essence when fighting an exponential growth
best
for your next chapter

again
i deeply sympathize
did you read the paper there is absolutely no such claim everyone
about syntax
the novelty of the paper is in training neural
to do symbolic integration
a truncated sentence from the abstract to dismiss an entire paper is pretty ridiculous

in most
we as
cannot predict if a technology will have a largely positive or largely negative impact we must warn about the potential
and we must imagine the potential
but we have no legitimacy to decide for society how to use a new tech


i m not saying we should not make ethical
we must make ethical
all the time for example i will not work on secret
if there is any possibility that they could hurt people but


they were not just nuclear
they were nuclear
directly working on nuclear
that s is a big difference there are ethical
with working on ai
that are specifically designed to kill people or spy on them
i think it is extremely presumptuous for
to think they can make ethical
for society technology can always be used for good or bad it is the role of society at large to decide how to use technology it is not the role of
to decide unilaterally


s model is the most accurate to predict

i don t think

have dramatically different age


that s just wrong the number of
is pretty much
of infected people regardless of how fast the infection
the herd immunity rate so
infection rate

of the population dead it might take

or


no the only way out besides a complete lock down is systematic mask test trace quarantine it
worked well for a number of
the us federal government is too incompetent too uncaring and too cheap to implement such a policy
i deeply sympathize

the problem is that somewhere between

and

of infected people die from it so if herd immunity is
at
infection rate that s
killing somewhere between

and

of the general population probably around

unless a vaccine is found before then


death per million per day meaning


per million per year over

before we get a vaccine or treatment that would amount to

to

of the population in excess
it s huge

to predict future
in a video you get blurry garbage the key issue is how to represent uncertainty it s easy in classification
not so easy when

i d agree with that with the caveat that handling uncertainty is both necessary and considerably harder than in traditional


uncertainty in classification is a mere

a distribution over video
is intractable

if they entice people to take the pandemic seriously to do right thing and they can be helpful if they entice people to value science and

the worst case is actually less than that the overall mortality rate is probably less than
and the herd immunity
the propagation when
of the population

number of death in
would be less than

still a huge number
it might be time to remind ourselves that before
the standard model used to explain shape recognition in psychophysics was template matching
was still the case not so long ago
if herd immunity is

building a conventional nuclear power station in the middle of any city would be pretty stupid building a

to go all wind solar without energy storage for which the technology does not exist at the

oversized
base which would sit unused whenever there is wind and or sun not cheap
given that micro physics is reversible under

i
take a nuclear power plant over a coal plant any day nuclear waste management is technically
it s only made complicated by irrational

what storage tech have you run the

use it if you have it
it is not because the cost of energy storage technology comes down that it automatically becomes scalable at the size

work is not available

i was not angry and i did read the paper but
the citation the first time around
you have to use
th order optimization of which evolutionary
are a special case when the function is non differentiable but the efficiency is so much worse than gradient based that it should only be used as a last resort

you are right i
the reference the first time

and that one is open source
might have been nice to cite this prior study on the same topic by my dear

before we can demonstrate the value of a theory we have to make them up
malik once
to me that to exist in computer vision you had to have a theory there were many of them in the

the diversity and flexibility of the

yes there is a number of

the entire field of computer vision

of recognition
was until fairly recently dominated by the
view of language pretty explicit
nice work but there is an
large scale study by an
team
a
powered
analyzer and unlike the
system it s open source tweet paper
i agree there are a few
for which one can engineer intelligent behavior pretty much what a big chunk of
is all about but for intelligence human engineering ingenuity is insufficient the recent history of computer vision speech and
is strong evidence to that
where i m
my
that self
learning will improve computer vision over the next year the way it


over the last year
so much for nativist
of human specificity
deep learning is far far more than old style neural
with more than a couple of

is an architectural language with enormous flexibility the bestiary of

there can be no intelligence without learning

the sad thing is that the ideal batch size is

ai will allow many more people to exercise their creativity by reducing the

you clearly have not watched any of my
of the last

not even read their
like the power and
of deep learning or how do we get
to learn like
and
all of my work is about current
and how to lift them

stochastic gradient descent just works even with very large and very deep


learning and classical
require too many

to explain how
and
learn so efficiently
a lot more technical stuff
that is what some

wrote about a very benign piece of work everyone at fair face palmed when these

we
t even advertise this work beyond a short
post we
t talk to the media except afterwards to set the record straight
no some other
may require big

to justify their existence and get continued
research at fair
sufficient value to
to enable it to focus on real technical
without
to oversell them through splashy

the discrete nature of traditional symbolic reasoning
it somewhat incompatible with gradient based learning but perhaps a continuous
version of it is possible one proposal is

that s certainly an important step in the right direction which may be why the orthodox

to minimize its impact

by the progress of

a conflict in which they can claim to be an important protagonist or both i don t see a conflict

perhaps but some have vehemently
that the substitution of

practically
an act of war against the symbolist orthodoxy
indeed that s pretty much exactly what i
been saying for several
and

for
if we re going to make reasoning compatible with gradient based learning we must replace
be

thank you for
us that our time is better spent getting
to do stuff rather than merely
that method x can t do y without any supporting evidence that would get
peer review credit comes to real
not vague

will
as i defined it above remain an essential methodology for ai
of future
yes and that
t preclude the use of causal inference
what s your opinion on the work of



on causal inference then
i believe that
defined as gradient based learning applied to
of differentiable
is here to stay so yes i think
is the right scientific model more accurately
is part of the solution though obviously its current
are insufficient
exactly
no need to convince me


next to me at fair
a

although a
with only one hidden layer is a little too simple to deserve the adjective deep
exactly but there is a clear definition of
see this thread
yes i disagree i tie

and similar
is a way to efficiently estimate
if you use gradient free
you are throwing this whole idea out the window in some
it s the only option but it s way less efficient
in all of this the
are
what architecture it needs to be compatible with

what learning paradigm and objective function



what training data and training protocol but trainable
of differentiable
are here to stay
don t say

t do logical inference when you really mean a plain feed forward neural net can t do long

but that s exactly my point the bias is in the data not in the model architecture nor in the learning algorithm
there is no such thing as artificial general intelligence because there is no such thing as general intelligence human intelligence is very specialized
let s call them the symbol

let s start with artificial rat level intelligence
then move on to artificial cat level intelligence
and so on to artificial human level intelligence

does not exist other than as artificial gerbil goose giraffe gibbon gorilla level intelligence
if you insist on learning through
likelihood or
a
you might need to compute the gradient of the partition function but then again you don t have to use
map the energy based world is full of other objective

how does logistic regression possess a bias say gender or ethnic there will almost certainly be some bias in the data it s trained on which is my point







something like that

self
learning
not because it
the math because it
optimization incomparably more efficient
actually

in the late
and many
since have
various ways to perform reasoning with
compatible
that
many of my dear fair

then what are you
about
if it
t then what is there an alternative principle to objective optimization aside from
style

this extract from our
article clearly
that reasoning and symbol manipulation must be made compatible with
it
to use meaningful
aka
of
your war is against this particular way of

it s your war
if there is a war it is from people who insist on a particular representation of

by discrete non differentiable
my hunch and
s is replace
by
of
and replace logic by smooth

i m on record saying that one of the big
of ai is to make reasoning compatible with gradient based learning so i m definitely not against
many

are
to do just that there is no war
full

replace optimization by
which generally involve
intractable
over the parameter space then you have to use
like variational
and you are back to optimization
a free energy
that s discrete combinatorial optimization hence
order hence slow have you tried tree search to train a neural net


is in its basic form a perturbative
order method way too slow
i don t disagree still the question remains as to whether there is a mechanism for direct efficient estimation of the gradient gradient free
order
are just too inefficient at the scale of a brain
if the brain
an objective then what do you propose the optimization method is
order gradient free
order
direct gradient estimation
order good luck some new class of
that no one is aware of i m just saying
order is too slow
gradient based
compute or estimate the gradient directly while grad free
order
like


population based evolutionary
estimate it indirectly through
the former is considerably more efficient when applicable
when
a function you can use
order
gradient free
order gradient based and sometimes
order gradient
curvature
do you have any alternative i m not aware of
my tweet was not about him
some people need to invent religious
to make themselves relevant since they can t produce real
nor experimental
of their own that are reduced to telling people that what they do is bad and that they should work on this other vague idea instead
another reason why the brain might be
gradient based learning is that the known
to it are too inefficient to be usable at the scale of a brain but that
that learning in the brain
some sort of
function
i m sure a number of people have had similar
at the same time i had it almost from the early days in

just around the time

he is saying what i
also been saying logic based symbol manipulation is incompatible with gradient based learning much of biological intelligence

and continuous
to do the
that

actually that is when

and



and that is when you
your
your anti
career was built around this conflict

had to spend
showing that yes neural

the point of this critique is that there is no idea to critique

it s not a question of acuity but one of visual

in the cortex the density of retinal ganglion
or optical nerve
does decrease geometrically with eccentricity the cortical area per fiber is constant see work on visual

but anyway the point is that there is not all that much disagreement over where to go next whether you call it causality or generative modeling or whatever we clearly need to build

there is a law in the us that

they did not take it down they

the model is highly non linear but yes

by
not sure why you say it s not taken into account in current

also lots of

that s why
will be with us for a long time that s also why the question what can t
do
no answer unless you add today much of the current
are
of
learning and
not
of


is not an algorithm it s merely the concept of building a machine by

functional
and training them with some sort of gradient based optimization method that s it you are free to choose your architecture learning paradigm prior



insane
school learning is only partially
schooling
a tiny amount of high level knowledge the vast majority of our knowledge is acquired early and in a self
manner without this background knowledge schooling would be ineffective see the cake
from
to artificially intelligent


the charter of the independent oversight board for
s content policy is

no the reason why the
community is largely
on
is because it works self
unsupervised is harder today self sup works really well in
not so much in vision yet
what you see as a flaw of an architecture we see as a flaw of the learning paradigm you want more structure in the architecture and we don t necessarily disagree with that we want a new learning paradigm that
more knowledge from raw data
self sup
this point
always been known but again it is a limitation of
learning not of the architecture deep or not

s focus on unsupervised learning for the last

and me for the last

from this
the
you implicitly mention are
of
learning and reinforcement learning deep or not not of deep learning per se
making that confusion
that s because we d rather spend our energy advancing the field than
with you about how to advance it

fair s self

system is now top dog on the general language understanding
glue


i don t think that
the potential behavior of other
more reliably than
is that hard
once every vehicle is autonomous the problem will be hugely simplified

human intelligence is nowhere near universal
actually recent progress in ai show that
suck at designing ai
that why we have to rely on machine learning to design them for us
not yet
yeah that s a pretty narrow task which is fortunate because you sure don t want to have people do it that said there are interesting causal inference
there look at this paper by



abate be my guest
it
t work that badly actually but it
a couple hundred
of equivalent real time practice for a single map
that s only one example
you are not wrong but recent progress

the spectrum
will autonomous driving with super human reliability be
before human level ai if yes then driving is a particular or relatively narrow task
recent progress in ai have taught us an important fact an intelligence as general as human intelligence applied to a particular task totally

to an ai system
to that task also human intelligence is not that general
sure but
accuracy is not exactly good you can get close to
with a linear classifier you can get
with nearest neighbor
distance no deep learning necessary but if you want more than
without losing your computational shirt go with

terrible idea this would simply slow down progress in the field case in point the
paper had

and was
several times before its official presentation at

the faster the field
embargo friction
i also disagree that
is a mere
of unsupervised i d say it s a particular form of way of unsupervised learning in which you essentially use

to predict reconstruct part or sometimes all of the input
what s ugly about it
i see nothing wrong with self
it
what it
the input
its own supervisory
the underlying
may be
but the signal being
is not distinct from the input i would settle for the more pedantic auto
