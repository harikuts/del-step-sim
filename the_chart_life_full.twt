thanks for
very interesting piece of
there


was the last

day

before that i don t think we got any in late august or on

june

and
were also

days and we now know that was an intermediate term top for a lot of

very true
big pop in new
day
at

very very solid number could be a bullish breadth thrust could be a blow off top i
seen both following a day like today
we saw a massive divergence in short term breadth over the last couple of
yet the broad indices have been able to fight it off with no dramatic correction i think it goes to show just how strong the demand for
is out there very impressive
some solid days of up volume to start the month
the
day on

trade invest with what
you best
impossible i was told a decade ago that no one
to own a house

there are
stocks to choose from some are going up some are going down focus on the stocks that are going up maybe you want to own it but if no one else
to own it and thus there s no one to sell to at a higher price does it matter
if you want to be on the wrong side of supply and demand that s your choice to make but over the long run you are
yourself at a disadvantage
let me check my
study

nice find joe


no set limit
more about risk reward and getting in as close to broken resistance as possible it could be a
stop loss if the breakout candle was big enough also if a stock is holding up on a relative basis that
for more cushion

i think so

were at this age

beautifully said
thanks tony
thanks

thanks so much

it s only natural


plus a few


that s awesome i tell this to people all the time but i
attribute my career and interest in the market to the fact that so many of our dinner time

around the market growing up

i
this on my first chat with but one of the

for me is willing to buy back in c at your original entry a after being stopped out b some of my best
have come from willing to get back in a stock much easier said than done

i agree
lots of
out there given the strong trend we have been in

these people do not understand how the game is
at all
no
i think we all feel that way
great chart

think so

great point there on the

use


t have said it better like it s worth whatever the last person
for it bottom line period

are just

said the wolf in sheep s clothing
i think
been waiting for a moment for
this is just her excuse to regulate something
yep and you only figure it out after
spent
on the

probably more than that
what does

even mean

yes since
have always reflected
for
and
up until this week
really appreciate that very nice of you to say
to be fair a lot of these stocks
t micro
not even close if we are
the standard definition of


micro
doing their own thing up nearly



a
rally off the march

but
never ticked above
not a great intermediate term sign for steel stocks further could this mean for
as a whole





silver
gold

or

big inflection point here for the dollar


ever waste your time on people in this industry who use the term



what a piker
my dad used to say this all the time growing up classic
quote

cool to see
glad you did share it

we have come to a short term impasse here i have my
as to which way it
but
be
either way at this point

right here
does he trade
yet
conn
nice find



absolutely love meeting smart people who put great content on
but it s such a bummer when they end up being a total a hole in real life
always fascinating stuff from



t being dramatic yesterday he was being realistic



a real beauty
this is the real discipline people need in their

we have been bullish for

and just beat the s
p
by
in
so
been pretty good so far

that is great

big
breakout now turning into a breakdown on solid volume as they say from

come fast
and i think you have to be aware of that behavior here
no doubt
i think lots of us market
are learning some
we
t know this week


logical that s not too far away below that probably

whatever the ultimate plan is i hope they succeed i think most people are
for them
they definitely have no clue what they re up against unless they have
trillion hidden somewhere

railroad stocks have gone from looking very strong to looking very weak not great for
not great for





i genuinely hope so
i m right there with ya retail is going to be
for this most likely via industry
for making too much money at someone else s game

it s incredibly unfair but the sec
let him do it which is the astonishing part i

to a couple people on the market making side of the saga and no one
it will end well
ken griffin
already dismembered his prey at this point in the chaos now he s just circling it and waiting for the final feast
agree i think the
are usually a better sign of weakening momentum as you pointed out we had back in early

what s your favorite dish i m not going to cook it but i
order it from

for these

just happy to be part of the team

telling us that we have

be very fun around here


not really
funny how it s always gambling to some people when money is made in the market but not in the fashion they themselves would do it
was it on
i will try to find a link to it
clear sign of demand here for

is that a common scam these days in recruiting crazy but i guess not too surprising

year treasury
now testing that

area from the top this was also the resistance point we saw in june and




now potentially turning the corner on a relative basis as well with a change in rate of trend
i m not sure what chart are you
to although there is no resistance in
to volume

are efficient right i know education
made you pay for
for it but you can go ahead and toss that introduction to financial
textbook out the window

i think it s very likely
this is exactly what it
become
it really is
i think

to a private discord anyways so have fun chasing them all over the
i guess
you think


make sure you catch the latest episode of the weekly trend

i do think some funds
on at some point i have my

a whole different rabbit hole to wander down

the collection ingestion and analysis of application infrastructure security and
data to derive actionable

exactly quite the double standard that we have
upon
i think they absolutely hate old school wall street and the
that funds have used for
and they turned it on them said it very well that combined with horrible risk management on
part
very well could happen
probably the but i bet there are more
type
on the horizon
yep
the
saga simply put is
coming for wall and broad i
think most people out there understand exactly
going on over at r
and the
behind it
not
like
as a

was just the vehicle of choice
also the risk management on the position in this instance was beyond non existent so no i
feel bad for
as the saying goes
stupid
win stupid


i
think
about good

bad
this is just a game there are simply
and

it


the recreational outdoor vehicle trend remains quite strong
for me
nothing more to it than price
not a long term holding just a trade but i understand your point
it s just a chart dude calm down
i have no idea

on the overall behavior if it s a gap would be less
to enter also
on how far away stop would be


s
you bet
longer term there is potential to go way higher than that

so
are a tool that
the relative strength of a stock against a
and then
that performance over time and then they divided it into
different
for a visual representation this is a good summary

these are the
leading the charge making a case for longer term relative strength for value stocks

the man who got me interested in international soccer at the age of
absolute legend
very true and something we must all accept
i was talking about market breadth but i do agree on your point as well
the spike in participation we saw in
in

to have carried right on into
yeah you can see it in the data but i also look at
upon
of individual

quite clear to me that there is a very strong demand to own stocks

time to study up on those

a period of indecision as
coiled around the early june
before eventually
higher


long term

one of the lesser covered
of ta is that

thesis don t let small

turn into bigger

i was wrong about
state very wrong it



is definitely not lazy maybe i should have worded it better learning is great but for me the best learning
been from simply doing it lots of subjectivity as to what works and what

all personal preference
at great expense to who you most
and
i know and follow here had a great year with their
i
know a single
who
been bullish since at least june


great
i think
going to have to
themselves into becoming clean energy
at this point as well and
sure they have the cash to do it

the year long term megaphone


not a fan of being
for the sake of being
big picture energy still
and it
t have a great end to the year while many other
did until it turns around on a relative basis don t be
if it s one of the worst

interesting to see so many on both the buy and sell side with

will there be a return to

expert
for
breadth yearly
japan and foreign strength what can a strong
mean for

first thought of the new year how can i get better
one of two
i never pass up if
on
same to you

the attitude you have to have to be successful in the long run everyone
their ass
when they start out
i say this to everyone buy side sell side retail institutional
value l s
day
whoever if you
give up on your
trading journey in a year like this and you for the most part kept your sanity pat yourself on the back

yes it was to build two
that is definitely what we need they also got

in the year and they just fired

why
t they
to same
as small
which would not have their

if they laid off

bring it full circle
good point it s really unfortunate

you both suck
did you just start you don t see the sell off that s coming perfect
a lot of people say they want to put in the effort to be great in a particular field of study a lot of those same people want the ease and relaxation of a

job
t happening sorry too many of your
are
in the extra
to be better than you
do you want to know the answer to a question or do you want to actually learn stop

take initiative discover go down rabbit
peel back
mess up a few times or a lot find what you like find what you don t like grow learn then do it again
let me give you the premise let s say you

per day no matter what which is
but the market
t hit a new high for
days you d just save all those

and invest
on the day it hit a new high instead of
individual


why can t you do your own due diligence for someone who
been at this for

surely this is not that hard to comprehend these
of
are done all the time
growth
value









as i said it literally
nothing about
on a single day how do you not understand that all time
can occur multiple times a year
pretty easy to understand you invest every time that market
a new high it
nothing about

highest day of the
how would anyone know that anyways

justify these high stock

yes since so much of what
in our
is
and logical

would
stocks breaking out to
year
be part of the global bullish thesis i think so

daily


there
to be a theme
i don t know what you re
that we trade in a range
what about it you re
an index to a
product why would they look the same
when in an uptrend always treat short term bearish behavior on the indices as an opportunity to find the relative strength under the surface
wrong link just


like to know

if we hold

i
wear orange
with the new
deal the
for sec
is
to increase from from around
million to roughly
million per year an increase of
at least that insane
we had to pay

seem too bad now
with the bullish
divergence at a logical place of support are we seeing a potential bottoming area in the relative strength of
stocks



pretty accurate
i think that
is definitely holding up the best of all the
and if you re a deep value investor now is definitely time to buy

more evidence to the notion that this should be a breakout that

good point
one could argue em stocks have spent the last
calendar
building a base in this relative relationship
it been enough to work off the downtrend and begin a new leg higher we will find out in the coming


huge if true


will be fine one day i m just saying right now they look weak maybe they turn around soon on a relative basis
not a horrible choice if you had to own something honestly even the data
have been lackluster
it
that way unfortunately
i
been informed this morning that
stocks are making new relative


for context this is what i am
to
lucky gal i m jealous

cash a clean test of the those same
let s see what they do with it
she was personally
by
bond himself i don t know what the big deal is
timber
definitely a different story

definitely a good one one the best
stocks out there right now ironically

you re
might be fine i just meant that

to hit relative

es f now below the


around


if there s one thing we can all agree on it s that we should be

in the current environment
another one in the pipeline

to you
thanks

i am excited to be included in this with a group of awesome

our buy
at the same time we can push this back up

it
saw the
commercial and turned the
off myself

i guess he
we all read his
first thing in the morning
hell no i
because no doubt you spent that entire

post making fun of people
it is

a
person
you have spent
publicly

and by the
of it based on your recent
you
quite give it up
dis you


you think

you because he made some broad statement about the fed do you think
that important
look at the original tweet
still trying to go after people who have been right for
while
been posting clips of you
basketball on your
which is an embarrassment in itself i
even go there
because you tried to call me out and here we are back at square one
got some advice for you lay low go work on that
word doc you call a
that
like my
mo old son wrote and come back to me when
ready to apologize for your

really because i
even know who you were until you
to put me on blast a few
ago telling people how ridiculous i was and
still doing it to
get a life

also show me that tweet where i said that are we just making stuff up now
nothing wrong with intellectual disagreement yet your entire
is
to
ta and specifically calling out
by name what s up with that are you jealous mad why dedicate so much time on people who have been correct while you
been wrong
i m not saying you have to give him the award but to insinuate


t one of the top
in

well
if you
t

you must be even

i had a really smoking hot take on
yesterday
have the
to share it publicly like the trade
so
to everyone

that you feel dumb even thinking about it and then it

excited for this
price

everyone
the hard way i did and when you accept this the maze
to get a little bit easier to navigate it
never be easy but every small edge you can develop really

interesting that
stocks have
us stocks by
since the
news and everyone telling you to never buy
stocks again because they re all fraudulent and of course
coming through in the clutch this morning again

no it

relative
this week on the other hand i m also not a fan of chasing
gap
so a lot of this
t necessarily fit my style of preferred price action trading but some individual
finally starting to calm down and find balance
for
a position there are some general
i use with mas not selling while still above an
ma is one of them

still riding that
ma
beautiful nice find ben
you are
correct to be
the
we are skeptical too in my mind the only way to
without tech
is we would have to have massive breadth pretty much everywhere else to make up for that

how about that
rut

do we see a repeat of this behavior from
i have no clue but i do think
to the underside of broken support are normal
and something we should all keep in the back of our mind

thank you



really excited about this venture and what s to come in





a definitive change in trend

a positive ripple effect of energy stocks seeing new




very interesting you don t see this too often
forgive me rick it is a great movie
good

ah that s a good one
the

rookie of the year

awesome
of the
we track
of them made new
day relative
yesterday of those
i d estimate

still have downward sloping intermediate term relative mas maybe it s finally the bottom for some of these
but i don t think we have confirmed anything quite yet
and they re equally as strong as the
on a relative basis



and plenty of individual
to choose from morn









capital
are certainly an area to keep an eye on



and
specialty
and
carbon




the relative strength here may be telling us something h t
in the

leading up to the move to
the
were

with

appearance however you could argue they were on track before that with

i know that bill
a
track record
a coach without
that s what i know i also know that
is most likely going to the
while ne likely won t see a
game for at least

if they don t land

and

as a
before that
i don t know what that
to do with my original tweet
i mean
s career
record before
was his starting
was

also an interesting take to say
was a below average
when he literally won a super bowl his first year as a starting

i always
if it was due to
or
i guess we now know

intuit
financial management and compliance
and
for
small
self employed and accounting



it s the
quadrant


there were
stocks with a market cap of
billion or higher that closed today above their respective

price

of these stocks closed in the lower half of their daily range

of these stocks closed below their daily opening price




up volume day with

this
very

color me unimpressed
no one
it because that was the year that most people trading today were born
i think you go with the stocks that are above their respective june
if it s up
today and still below that level it s a laggard

i guarantee you they

like
million to come up with that
i don t really have a macro take but we hit
year
in
stocks today so it probably can t be that bad



finally above those early


energy on a relative basis is back to where it was
days ago

good
thanks for

ideal no of course not possible absolutely
on the flip side if they choose to fill these
watch out
keep that head on a swivel just






security
i think as long as we are above
it s
to be involved here
they found a way to trigger another circuit breaker before the year was over bravo

basically


i m a fiduciary we are
uptrend or downtrend i have spent my entire career looking out for what s in the best interest of our
i don t like to watch people knowingly take advantage of
by selling chaos and fear yes this is a hill i will die on


super creepy he s in a league of his own there


no again you don t get it i m also
to warn people about
too and i m
to manage said risk what you do on the other hand is make money off convincing people year after year that the economy is going to collapse and we are all doing to die it s lame


so you admit
just selling fear then no actual proof just economic
and scary


so glad we
have an official
department or
probably be getting a talking to later today


no it s not you just think it s a
chance you have no proof you just want to sell fear and at this point you re so dug in on this being your personality in the financial arena that you can t let it go or you
dread looking like a failure

that s what i m



my life is at risk every day getting into my car and driving down the street i don t whine about it
i m not driven by envy i m driven by calling out people like you who are complete

and take from good people


literally no one person on the face of this earth
that not even you
there you have it
there you have the true colors can t talk about reality so he
personal


you
it
i can debunk the sky being blue but we all know the truth
i don t believe in your
people who don t know any better that s
being a


i d love to stay and chat but it s now past lunch time and i
got to get back to work for our
who are literally paying me to right and not simply have an opinion enjoy your
and




because you have no skin in the game you
t licensed your opinion
no effect on anyone besides the poor people you scam so who
you re wrong you
been wrong you will continue to be wrong bottom line period
i have a high enough
to know when i m wrong and i m right and you
been wrong for
pal give those poor people their
back
i m the scam artist imagine if you were actually
to my
legally and ethically and had to act as a fiduciary instead you get to go around for

and crying about the world it s so lame get a new



just admit you re wrong it s
man just admit it and feel the weight
off your
don t ruin your financial future over
such a big ego i d also say don t ruin your reputation over it either but we are past that stage


you
been calling for a reset for





and then we got one actually two and you were too busy all
up in your bunker to take advantage of it imagine getting a
like that and

he s exactly right you re a self
financial marketer with a platform that you choose to use to spread fear and con people out of money literally the
type of scum this industry can produce
so because that investment philosophy
t worked out for you you shame the entire industry you are the epitome of a sore loser man i cannot fathom crying this much and blaming other for
that you made again pathetic
what i have a problem with
is that you are a
scam artist and you know it you haven t been right in

and yet you continue to sell people on fear and chicken little
it s pathetic i
never seen a person who
reality like you do
good show
self storage
strong again early in the session
cube

yep
agree

exactly we



between march and june that money went towards other stuff
but i would have preferred to go on those

negativity never
in the long run
the real issue with jess always
been
probably a smart guy but he is just too far down
sky is
rabbit hole
odd take of course there
been a shift people literally had their
taken away from them and the
are already shifting back is the average person more likely to buy a
or travel to
in
that
t mean people have
their

on top of that he said he would want to go work for science
yeah because
in those
have always been on the straight and narrow
to wall street

jess
true but discouraging an entire generation to ignore a field of study simply because you
t handle being wrong and
with the
of reality pretty weak what other field would you succeed in with that attitude
imagine being this mentally weak
well it

today to figure this out will be good learning thanks for the feedback
thanks for the insight i figured was on the right track i just need to figure how to write what i am looking for i am watching some

now they re great
that works but is that relative to an index
though i need new relative
versus
or another

look for new relative
via price data not necessarily return based
for all my

partially
maybe it
work out this time i m skeptical every week on the

throw a few

see it last longer than

to get serious about it
raise your hand if you are ready to be let down by
and value stocks again
notice that a lot of the strength actually
t in the
although they
been incredible stocks in fact the
stocks tied to the residential construction theme are the
that
have to buy and install
take
for example awful close and a perfect technical rejection off of
a level everyone
been watching would be have been so easy to continue lower but we got
from
now obviously this can all eventually blow up and we go lower but until then
i think there s zero conviction from
to seriously follow anything through to the downside at this point because we get dumb
and then the stock just
new
the next day anyways same with the indices on lots of days
that is correct
it
broken all of our hearts at least once in

i do i do love it indeed
yes but i
t buy if the stock
an er coming up in the next

days from when i d want to enter
one of the
that and i keep going back to is all the weak
and
daily
we have seen over the last


and yet most of the time we don t see any follow through i think that s somewhat telling of the environment we are in

maybe just maybe we are on to something here

primarily as

i keep that stock in my portfolio because well i already own it
can t trust these media
the only way to know the
of the situation the real honest look in the mirror truth is to come to
with what the current price action is saying not what it might do not what the
say it should do but what it is doing
would also mark the first back to back
days since june
which saw a

worried that
