i try
today i learned that
and

are the same thing
yea
been going live mon

am
reefer and now the
got the
and
too

like a favorable risk
reward if we re above those


the best part is how they always think that one day people will want to go back to that life
but it s not
and

who are pessimistic about the present and future are just not talking to the right people there s so much awesome being built right now by really smart and experience market
it s fascinating to watch people need to open their
it s awesome out there
i m getting a lot of
about


was
near the end of the last cycle naturally
so not a lot of great
in commodity
land any
on good liquid

if you pay attention you
find that most people would rather worry about what they think should be happening instead of just paying attention to what s actually happening amazing how easy it is to distract our competition pretty sweet
if you ask me
shout to and
ride




hey join us on clubhouse at

pot stocks buy them high and sell them higher
so drink more barolo then
always
why do people hate


semiconductor part of our
to
club cree

a thing we do
as i recall
was a good time to be
stocks

some call those

it s my way of saying that fundamental analysis
like a huge waste of time
china

tech check check check
how funny is it that
is about to break out to new all time
here s the fundamental analysis

a hospitality company



and

and

like a great business in this environment

is this a half decade long base breakout in

it s just a list of stocks showing an unusual increase in investor interest they are neither longs or shorts after we create the list then we hand select the best long short





looking forward to football season starting

really really really good seriously
this is my favorite player
when are there not what does that have to do with the fact that stocks are in


more like opportunity cost by my math
is that why they get

less than

or is why the

are worth
of what

are worth try to help me out here

keep reading it
worse
our latest under the hood report is up first we put together a list of stocks seeing an unusual increase in investor interest then we overlay our technical analysis to hand pick the best
both long
short
this
list



and they even get my credit card company to take the default risk hell of a racket
so i lost both my
tonight which
a
loss in my account just
after my deposit should i go crying to mommy about it do we need better gambling education to stop from me making reckless
should we be
that the system is
against me



also took







on the game but
care who

wow did anyone catch that commercial hilarious

bet is in



passing
my bet for tonight nothing else
oh yea that too and pizza from
where i grew up


the over

from
cherry pie from grand

king



cheese


fried chicken
a little bonus chart session in between the heat
game and the super bowl this is my kind of

nope

no better
than shout to
this is really interesting
what the heck is going on


we got that breakout this week in

next up

x
gross
these are not the
of
that go up when stocks are in strong bull
and what do you know they re all making new

they re all working except for one
when the black line does what the blue line did watch people get all offended about it
is it not like this
what confidence i see lack of confidence and
spiking
how is it possible that stocks keep making new all time
they re in
there s more demand for stocks than supply of them that s not my opinion that s just a fact there may not be as much demand for stocks in your household but that s your problem not ours
what so not an uptrend what s the problem


yes of course
how that works
even ban you from entering the casino if
good enough
pretty awesome so far pretty much exactly like

no one should feel bad for me no matter how stupid my
might be
not
problem but mine my family and the
i
understand why anyone should feel any sympathy for me whatsoever
people have their own
why should my
be theirs too
president of what

an adult if i want to be a moron
no
fault but my own if i want to bet my mortgage on
coin toss then
an
and
not
fault
not the
fault
not

fault or

on me period obviously
i just
a gambling account on
and made a deposit in about


a terrible gambler and know next to nothing about it will the media write
about how much money
about to lose and how other people are responsible for my stupid

yea but what about gold

i just
understand the coaster and stemware that just
make any sense and
spill written all over it
i think we could all use more
in our

i read a story in the news that drove me to make a stupid decision on a stock i lost a lot of money so then i stopped doing that and got interested in
instead

trade all night so the

period is less relevant than ever and will matter even less with each day that



before and it will happen again i promise

argue
doing so pretty formally
great perspective from as usual
small cap momentum now also breaking out on a relative basis this chart comes from this morning
this is your competition
this is great
so then not a downtrend
non confirmation
mean divergence


been eating
my
sent me all day


love it


three


all that is behavioral and have nothing to do with the goods and
in which the company

taking
today on clubhouse come on in
they
matter to me which is all that
to me and what does this have to do with fundamental analysis this is a behavioral book and therefore
technical analysis
well said
just

new book pretty
to dig in
the us
yield is the most
of
you
following along for a while know how helpful this
been for
if
above those

the bond collapse should continue throughout

the market is so awesome
diagonal trend

that important to me
the horizontal
that we pay more attention to
welcome to

ha nice find
actually yes just change it to log scale and
good to go nice job
behind the

it up with

in regional
pointing to higher

join us on clubhouse for a chat about reality gossip free now today

at

am
on


tortilla
buffalo
in honor of them not being there
here come


a good point ha

hate i see it everywhere
only hurting yourself smiling


the
or even
it is technical analysis does the
represent the behavior of the market
its
or are you
the goods

in which the market
so merely
the existence of the
is you being a technician

hilarious
they call them

talk to me


join us on clubhouse at


but

happening in the market not what people think
be happening but
actually going on

important see you there
good
new post people are
of their own shadow stocks at all time
strong
the world
never been a better place


with sentiment falling off a cliff and we have more
than
how is that even possible

i m coming on to chat with the
in a couple

it
nothing to do with
on a trade
the analysis of the ratio and

you can position yourself accordingly without a pair of
like
not really the point here
yep

be honest
you look around the world
not enough
of
yet to become a problem
i
hate anything they can both double or go to zero and it
matter to me i
care

my question and i still
have a good answer at what market cap does it become systemically relevant

half that twice that would love to hear
on this

is it
happen that would be huge
is that a thing
huge fan
wait to go back
not far
i love
i employ several and i love eating and skiing there
is gold bug ground zero i figured they
like my
they
but were still really cool about it all love brother

part is i actually think
bullish for
although they took it way worse than that one time i told
gold
at a gold bug conference


ago that gold was a good short the
were cool the
not so much which is surprising
it
i told a
room on clubhouse that if all the
went to zero tomorrow it
matter to anyone who actually
and there are no global


how do you think that went

good if everyone could handle it then no one would be able to make money
the

just put in its highest monthly close in history in my experience new all time
are regularly
by all time
go back and check you
see if it s above
i don t see a reason to be pessimistic towards stocks
guess what we don t like some of the
we don t like some of the people who make
enforce those
we certainly don t like some of the people taking advantage of the
the
profiting from it all or the system in general so what
yea there are a few
they tell me it s a bubble they tell me i m too complacent they tell me the system is
i tell them to pay attention because we haven t even broken out yet the dance is just about to get

about
like it s nineteen ninety nine
that s right
like a better idea than crying about it like a baby

t people just get
at the frequency detailed in the contract they

the smart and profitable
would probably say that yea so what
stocks are breaking out of bases and we want to buy them don t beat yourself up for missing a trade that
t fit your personal

is a bad idea sentiment very bearish right now so bullish for stocks we re here only to profit not stick it to


from today s clubhouse w support
from

high in spy stop treating
like
just take their money don t follow
rule or sports
into
risk management is most important
at the beginning of every month i get together with my boy josh brown to talk about some of the biggest
going on in the market here s this month s show
it s not our job to worry about irresponsible behavior it s our job as
to take advantage of the weak handed weak minded and
we re here to extract money from the market while many of them are just making regular
i prefer the former


hey
join us today at

on clubhouse silver trying to join the squeeze party

hit
mo relative
how
can help manage risk and identify

the next big move join us as we try to figure it out
they re so
they re so angry they re
on what
should be doing and what
should or should not be doing instead of just
on their own
and risk management let them stay distracted it s their problem not ours good

are so
some
actually show more
than
hedge funds
at a historic pace
and family calling me worried about the next crash meanwhile stocks all over the world are coming out of bear
and breaking out to new

new
month
for

relative to the s


spy the bearish to bullish reversal
exactly where this trend got going in
when
first
maybe it s a coincidence i m
go with no
great thread nice job
low vol stocks have been a downer all around the world not just us
money does go to those

the point you just
know about the
until after the fact so who
in the

i
feel bad for people who think the price of a stock should reflect the


our job as
to extract money from that sort of ignorance period

at all the

cry more about it
just ping peter
just sent an
about it you not on the distribution list
the
revolution will not be

you can t educate away their craziness there s no pill to cure them from being crazy no matter what you do they will still be crazy and they will only get






cake
si o no
interesting dynamic going on in
with the

stuck below
year resistance while the


is above those

of resistance and successfully finding support there

i m

not every candlestick in an uptrend is going to be the
looking candle it
t make it not an uptrend go back and look at every single one of the
uptrend in world history you
find plenty of ugly
along the way stop

no not at all
is the rotation out of small
and back to
leadership too obvious i hate when
are so obvious because it s usually not that
any

i still really think the

just got going i can t think of a better catalyst to spark that than crude oil trading below zero who could have possibly been creative enough to put that one in their
i see no evidence that
are prepared for this
what
and
all over the world are finally
out is that we re much better off
on the behavior of the market itself and therefore its
instead of the goods and
in which a particular market
it s
technical analysis

is that
level

oh it was funny i
it not the point tho right
some people are obviously

join us today at

on clubhouse

the stock market
work silver
higher

highest the level ever w

decline stocks are in an epic bull market deal with it
if


on
separate
in the same episode that the stock market
t work do you think there s a higher likelihood that it actually
t work or is it working just fine

does insurance get this expensive right before
glad you had it or does that usually happen when the insurance
necessary after all

true
how many times have you
that this squeeze
is going to crash the market is that usually what
right before a market crash
i know the silver
have been telling me that since the silver crash
a decade ago
i prefer


or as
for





the intern with his latest note

i got on the silver train a year ago you catch up
just been waiting since august for the next leg higher o begin and our patience
been



when life
a door open it back up that s how
work
here s a nice list to sort through to find new

here s one i like
new post get
or do the squeezing this is technical analysis



the behavior of the market and its

not
the goods

in which the company
i don t even see how that s relevant
it was
on our under the hood report in

which monthly chart stood out the most to you this weekend

just embarrass her tho


are the


or robin

go get em


the math work out to not my area of

i
support
who think market
should reflect something as trivial as
she should retire and go away

better than squeezing irresponsible short

not a new phenomenon to be clear and
always been one of my favorite technical

our list of stocks w short interest in excess of
and days to cover ratio of at least

yea so
that work out to around


the silver squeeze already officially

up another couple in

should we check with this lunatic to make sure
reflecting the
should we use p e
how exactly does this work warren not so g
yea but what if you adjust for inflation
this time is different
the

know what
talking about

is fun to watch play
got the
if he
getting better as
shown he can look out

almost certain of it

are way above my pay grade
going to have to speak to the higher

father in law
the hell is going on with
and why is it hurting the



dangerous her ignorance is the only
i see why should
give a
about
or

is she talking about
who is
her ignorance is her problem and the poor people who listen to anything she
fortunately we know better

i think only serial
use
for glassware with

garden
spicy
food


it done
set you back either

i
even have one of those yet

for me
teenage


true
thought of it that way
champagne blanc de blanc
her
are



did you hear what this maniac said this week sen warren to sec take
to ensure
reflect


it s been happening for

it s fine

hey
stick it to the silver shorts
like a good time

yea you should try
like
but without the communism
i don t know enough about it to know who is cheating and who is not it s not my area of
i stay in my lane
new post the
part about this week
i have no say in the matter it s my job to take advantage of the
not to judge what
should or should not be
to do that s not my place or area of
for that matter
yea exactly there s a lot that i don t agree with but i don t get a say in the matter so i have to
try to profit from the
or not it s that simple the rest
t my problem
that s nothing new so what
why is it our problem that


t know the
this is all common sense and not anything new it s not our responsibility as
to hold

that s their problem
every broker
order flow not sure why
is being picked on it s nothing new it s disclosed and they all do it
yea i have no issue with actually just

disagree on this
but they are i
get a say in the matter my only role here is to try to profit from it all


i agree with everything you said
both
said are simply not true

and

are
in these hedge funds
much more blurred than just

poor people it
work that way
how many


you
think hedge funds made money on these

argue they were probably behind it all
be
otherwise plenty of
did very well this month plenty of
lost their
after

both those
are incorrect by a lot


you
actually believe that do you cute marketing angle tho

fine they may have learned that too


the proper wine
for this kind of market
something with higher alcohol
probably
most appropriate how about a
from
this barolo right here will give you the high acid high tannin and high alcohol

looking for
not better behavior speeding up the blowing up process which is when the learning first
you and i know that but only through those






the whole ecosystem but
gave the easy access credit wear due whether that was their intention or not
when the story is written well after the fact and all of you
down and
on from being angry at this to being angry at something else
find that
ended up
the financial literacy gap better than any other single entity in human history watch
the best in the business still
save us from being human
the
part of this week
to be how some people actually think that

better is going to stop them from making reckless
i guess you
know how
work maybe
the one who needs the education

these days don t know the struggle


ill never forget it i was in
for a college football game
not that morning
my stomach still



hey
help the cause
for me it s when that former support in silver
turning into resistance that s when i
get interested again
si f
your
don t know how
work they make that quite obvious every day that s not new here s today s example you re on your own they don t know what s going on counting on them is irresponsible thinking they re helpful is even worse
the way i learned it was as goes
so goes the rest of the year

can t own apple if it s below



i was there before that when we were stuck with the



we re live come join us
hat tip


nice
meet me at the clubhouse at



business

participation gray

what can i do about that i have to pick my

i
watch television
i got good at
my
more wisely
whiskey was more necessary then
the scary part is that i know i got more of those
coming
can probably tell you a lot more than i can
i
read all the
but its a little fuzzy go back and check but the

in the
i m pretty sure
the game and it s been happening ever since it s a normal part of
its healthy
it
take care of itself always does
the reckless along the way it s beautiful to watch
i learned my lesson when i was short
in
and woke up one morning to a new rule that you
be short
boy did that suck i got over it i was a big boy i
go crying to mommy
yes in the same fashion and even bigger
no
been happening for



i don t care not my problem
don t they do fundamental research or something like that
terrible not really my thing
i feel like a
parent when one of our minor

into mid cap status big
to fulgent genetics


this month in our small cap report

all our


stocks in one of the
market
ever is rarely a good idea so short
are being
so what irresponsible longs also get
when stocks are in
their not right now again so what i don t see the problem with any of this
i don t know anything about them

there are


out there this goes for both

stocks some win some lose none of this is anything new here s snap who
t
about you china trump




or anything else that may offend you it s just an uptrend
exactly so if you want better service you
pay up
life
get a better broker then you want free

get what you pay for
let them think whatever they want who
why is that any of our
if it
people happy thinking
screwing over clothing no one even
then so be it so what
eh

do they teach you in troll school how to quote the dow in
instead of percentage




above important support if

this is still a stay long and strong name target over
higher spot

that would not be bullish
i consistently find the
to be a distraction for

not anything new
always been the case
no better than the gossip

aisle price

potential stock market

spy




when stocks go up shorts often get
so what
just because it came out of nowhere to

mean it came out of nowhere
why
people understand that is it because
crazy
let s take a look at the vulnerability of gold mining stocks to continue their epic collapse relative to stocks both the s

and

spy

you may not like what s going on but
in the
clearly do
to be clear it s
potential resistance we don t know if it was resistance or not until afterwards
but they can and they do and
information we can use
yea but the fed is
the market

and the over
just to put
in perspective when won his first ring i was a sophomore at and
with a lot of
from mass i had

all throughout the
and super bowl and bought myself a
with my winnings i still have it
and god forbid

on a trade and
it
china


there are stocks i want to buy so what
dude that was last spring when we got full on bullish
i feel like we
seen this before

it was
all along

this
better

do it
in
thank you for this

left to buy apparently most


only drink red wine white wine is for
good more for me

i have

of short
how should i get the job done
zoom out on the
and
relative
they were in place for a while so you think they rotate back into


relative seasonally
that time
it
yea you had the
then too energy was the obvious culprit there already making new relative
but

too far behind
the
fighting it lose money
have you ever
what a face ripper is well here s a great example of one holy



bull flag in tech relative to s


when you look at cyclical
in stocks throughout history you can point to a sector or group of stocks and say
those are the
dragging down rest of the market that s the culprit if stocks are about to come under pressure which is that sector or group
does the
follow its
and finally get above those



yea i think
right
it can also just be an uptrend shorts tend to do poorly in that sort of environment right
probably a better signal for
but yea
when consumer
are
that s normally a sign of risk aversion let s check in on how
are doing
the other


like on fire and burning down or on fire like hot and ripping
thanks i m not interested in the company
thanks i don t watch basic cable
recipe
sorry to hear
not a math major huh
keeping it going

up next classic chard


that people who say they
like

actually know what
is kind of like a technical analysis
and common sense
well it s a bull market for stocks there should be little demand for
and as it turns out that s exactly the case
terrible for who tho
maybe i m happy to buy them if that s the case


all of that is possible but why is that our problem what can we do about that it s our responsibility to profit from the
regardless of what those
might be that may not be healthy for some
but again what control do we have of it none

have
stocks not

healthy for who


does that bother you
my favorite
to get is an
that comes from i can t help it always
me smile
new post
out of

no not at all
right but those
you re
me in hurt my
so many
and colors i can t look at them sorry

i
seen this week

got a box of shiny
out back do you think anyone

wow good call


in a row march back to mid week month

just
the last trading day of the month is next
love it when the weekly and monthly
line up on the same day so convenient



naw
cool
a nihilist
just over here trying to make the world a better place one chart at a time


we re even seeing bullish breadth
in energy i mean does it get any worse than energy stocks and even they re seeing a relentless bid

the
small cap index

since

lose again

coming



a
come on


be serious this was a joke my wife
give a
and i definitely
the barolo come on
if any
really got me thinking these days

be

please take me off this thread i
give a
whether the stock goes to zero or
it
change my life
if whatever religion
a part of
a lack of risk management and
to losing

probably involved with the wrong church

average down
is how i learned it

a week night come on
wife
an

noir for chicken
night this is the situation i could a drink the
with her b become so offended that i protest dinner altogether c smile and open a barolo


the news people think a pullback in

is overdue this comes just days after

ended a pullback that


overdue

it s true

a



bull call spread
are the
back
oh yea it was
on our monthly conference call
night
i feel like
seen this before
the new
supercycle
go
always pinch the y axis is how i learned it

oh yes i order my
from japan crazy good
yea and my
are simple
truck style
seriously
yea exactly
what i felt guilty about it but the guilt is going away
is it wrong to use
for
night because this


in a row now and
not sure
ever going back
pomp i think this is a common misconception this whole
been in a long term bull market in
when
actually the opposite stocks are coming out of long term bear
that have

in some
i think this misconception is a win for

dry creek or

no one said that i
know what your issue here is
what kind of wine do you pair with a

exactly
wrong with that
i fully understand stocks pay
and
a popular thing in
that
change the fact that by my work the
have made no progress in over a decade

to have a different opinion i
mind
what do stock
have to do with

here s the stocks

chart
you think
t it
what would it take for the long term
bear market to end how about crude oil trading below zero that s probably a good start
i personally
care if it goes down every day let it go to zero not my problem i only want to own it if
above

this is a great chart it really
how there is no negative correlation here with stocks at all
imagine being so preoccupied with trolling and calling me a
for the past

that you
this whole rally

strong breadth
excessive optimism strong breadth is helping mitigate some
over excessive optimism the new high list
expanded and the number of net new
on

have now
their

peak h t

you don t even care about the company you re just
the stock because of personal greed yea so
our minor
report
at small cap stocks b w

market cap making new
and working on graduating into mid cap status there have been huge
here across
and industry
always good new

this
scan
they must be looking at the house upside down
hong
down over decade
down for over a decade


japan

like every market in the world

for quite some time much harder to find a market that
been in a bear market
respectfully
stocks are still in a
year bear market

ending a
year bear market us financial index in a
year bear market the
industrial


transportation
both just ended
year bear
i count plenty
classic rotation
technical analysis of stock
by





bull
unless big

as a bowling movie is bowling a sport
as opposed to what
the video from tonight s live conference call is now up and the

are available to
premium

well which is it

i like how you have a whiskey and wine
global growth
when you first start

you pay a lot more attention to
when you grow up you focus less on
and much more on price itself these are
we need to learn the hard way this
longer for some people and that s unfortunate for them
warren

gold

because people rather own stocks and other
than

silver s serial

t anything new lower
and lower

both stocks and
since the summer the trend
not
in fact it
vulnerable to get even worse
si f

spy
you re not going from
billion to
billion in market cap by making a lot of new
that s just math so we
been looking for the
making new


the stock market starting
in a market
since
weakening breadth and momentum flight to defensive
it was quite obvious well before any major


tech
u s tech
always


getting it done great post
good
this sort of behavior is a classic characteristic of
where
more demand for stocks than supply for them
i
know who that is
i
care about what the company does i let people like you waste your time with that stuff
just
and math for me i consider it a life

no
the thing i will never care i
even care what they do
not my problem

it s not that we don t know it s that we don t care
i d say the direction of the
from these
are pretty important






that s how i see it

is this what s going on
what do you think

e commerce


just because you once read in a book somewhere that the market
about your

t mean it s actually true sorry
what was the most informative chart you came across this weekend

willie
of his athleticism and power

for his ability to defend all


just

and i hate the

the best
willie



you play to win the game
what if it already

how many pro football hall of fame
did not also have a
that made the hall of fame
which


are down over the past



down over the past

us
down over the past

dow
and dow
did nothing for

and just broke out in

like long bear
are ending
i
think evidence is ever
but
been
for since the spring that
stocks is a much better approach than
them and
no evidence yet to suggest
that strategy

not certain of anything
i
see any bubbly
are
of

seeing most
around the world breaking out after no progress for a long time
i honestly
know joe was an economist i thought he was the new president
all very

maybe
barely gotten

click

their problem right

consumer discretionary
just not any

click

talking about
for one and
also pointing to their performance relative to the stock market not sure where your neighborhood
into this discussion
click
the price data comes directly from the exchange it s actually really easy to find
very different
u s real estate is the worst
the gold fund

never been worth less relative to the

have you ever
what relative strength
like here you go
not sure if you
saw technology breaking down to new
year
relative to the
this week





new all time
what are the bearish
of one of the most important stock market
on earth
a
year base to the upside
here s a really interesting battle line between supply and demand that should have some much bigger global macro

really blowing here out relative to s

would say a lot about the global growth
trade

no i
that
terrible
because it
like the


more supply than demand according to math
was that it
talk about from

comes fast


i probably would skip business school altogether and major in something easier so i could have more time to party and more time to intern which as it turns it were the best and most valuable
about college

not my fault that the market
care about the
you think it should care about
maybe
you
in a bubble
ha i was
that today too
if you
ever
what sector rotation
like just study the past

and you
got a

what times

like a downtrend
i
been waiting for
to break out since i was in high school that was over

ago and people have the audacity to tell me that stocks are in a bubble
fine but we haven t seen it
although i kind of wish that was a play on this not being a
breakout in which case we can be best
just lie to me and tell me that was your intention

t history proven that they re not
no i don t really

my point here is that when people question the strength in
the lack of a bid for the defensive

it mathematically impossible for stocks not to go up these
need to catch a bid
yen

if this is a market we should be

the irony that real
are actually hypothetical
for us it s more important to track what s actually

a possible real yield
seriously does this strike you as an environment where stocks should be going down come on stocks all over the world have been doing well as they should be what s the problem
as opposed to all those
times
had
probably mostly due to more demand for those stocks than supply of them
that s their problem



doubt it
not sure if you saw but
just went out at their highest weekly close in history
yes that s right even with all their exposure to bank stocks all time


you probably can i was a pitcher through college and we
t
to do heavy upper body now that i don t have a coach yelling at me i m working on getting my bench up i m


looking to put up

i m no where near there
that s not our problem if people want to lose their money in
instead of
assets in
that people obviously want they can do that people are free to lose as much money as they want i m not going to stop them
so
why does


and why does
x

i don t know it just does
no
what does one have to do with the other you re betting on the

based on what
in the
game

to say the least
it s far
warren was
to stocks for gold he
it
dug out of the ground in
or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it it
no utility anyone watching from
would be scratching their head

how about the fact that the us dollar got smoked and gold still
t rally
you
want to see what an uptrend
like let s go to japan

and sake
year


no one
to own these
they d rather be in other
or in stocks just not gold anything but gold apparently
gold
to make a great case for being the worst commodity to own


only according to





what
me
when i

level
i celebrated by going to peter
with my
this was
none of them knew or
what a
was they were there for the porterhouse a lot of fun tho
for passing level

nice


grant
i
tell if
being sarcastic or not

coming
i was
in an interview this morning what i think of joe
economic plan
how do you think that went
i know i
tho
no i don t care either way stocks can double from here or get cut in half not my problem
it s not my fault that you think stocks are expensive
the worst
if
a

enjoy this
wife made sure of it
invest in
with good

i like it but
with the zero
the problem
with
pair of

my
mo old daughter just
out her first ticker symbol baba
just because
not very good at
market breadth and sentiment

market breadth and sentiment
work
new post stocks are historically expensive so what spy



a characteristic of an uptrend

the dip in


technical analysis
you know those days where everyone leaves you alone and you can just listen to music and rip through
of
those are great days
do you
want to check my math is that a new
week high for
bank
when i tell people stocks have been in a correction for
they get mad at me but all of the world s most important stocks have been correcting since the end of last summer that s just a fact and

month is a long time what more do you want
new
to

we re looking for the next

our sweet spot is between

and then we overlay our technical analysis to find the best

are acting
right it s just that they keep looking around the wrong

been to them wearing a

no that s the best part
can you imagine the

every night the latter will probably serve you better over the long run


bull market water if
ever seen one

oh yea like one day or is there a date that your math came up with

do nothing but pull back and correct since the summer you re looking for a correction what the hell do you call this
exactly
not sure if you
saw this
new post your power to revoke distress
be mentally obese it s a bull market you know
that s exactly what we hope for around here
try harder
new
episode is out

to have jeff

join me for a really fun chat if you know jeff you already know that
quite the character the
he
from his early days in the
and
are awesome give it a listen
is that a serious question come on
you re insinuating that there s a self
dynamic taking place which is simply not true and mathematically impossible
not really
no
they matter to the market they just
matter to me
i like it when they call me a price
i
been
way worse
yes and it is
who said
don t matter
thank you for your brilliant analysis

know for me
only a long if
above the

a bad trade

yea we use both old dow theory and new definitely
weigh the evidence


for you dow theory
it
that both the dow
industrial
and dow
transportation
will make new all time weekly

historically these
happen in market
that reward
for
stocks not for
them
gold was falling while the dollar had already been falling that was the tell
yea that s hilarious why you re
t




rather own stocks that are going up instead of
that don t pay anything or

dust it s a supply and demand game there s not enough supply of stocks and quite obviously an overwhelming amount of supply of the

still true
just a few

here s the video from my
interview yesterday they keep
stocks
stopping you
and yes

rally was relatively weak
up only
but he
up and that s more the point so not really anything to do but continue with what s working
sure i don t disagree with any of that but that s not my point here we re looking to make money in the market that s it the analysis and
are not for any other reason my family came from
in the early
you want to talk about
storm trust me i know

not
what

not my place to judge
just observing sentiment that is all

not saying anything
doing is wrong

to do whatever the want
just observing

not my
that

here
i
know not my problem
no thanks that
terrible
i think that stocks making new
with bearish sentiment can be a really bullish combination for


always had some good
on this
i think magazine
can be a helpful gauge of sentiment you
have to be so sensitive about it
just
in on sentiment
all
the s

dow
industrial
and
composite all hit new all time

check in again on media sentiment
which part of no appreciation in

is the bubble
when stocks are in

perfectly normal for them to go up
financial stocks are loving this current environment


breaking out
here are a few


all for the

to make as much noise as they can to help other

stay as distracted as humanly possible the
there is only getting bigger keep up the good work news media you make our
easier the expense of your audience

not doing a sober
but i am trying to drink more wine from the southern hemisphere

always told them that s
the market

them that it s
too
no thanks
the u s

next

new happy hour w

major
to be long for the next decade


education
for those wondering yes


up for the rally this year
this is perfectly normal market behavior nothing to see here carry on with what you were doing before
a new young
report just
these are stocks that we believe will pay us to make money they
raised their
for b w

consecutive
we want to own the

remember the

rally period
tomorrow so far coming into today the s

is up

and dow
industrial average is up

during this period which is perfectly normal market behavior

the signal is when they don t go up

got you covered
we re scouting the farm system this morning and taking a look at our latest minor
report which
the best trade
for stocks between

market cap one of my favorite



are not rolling over a relentless bid in these stocks is just not characteristic of a stock market that s under pressure to me it actually
the opposite

the old
prime time indicator hit tonight
in the
quarter
animal
one with a lower cost of living
imagine those people
done well in a long time
some would argue that the
best
is not from
but actually from back home in southern

a huge fan
who
for those moving to
the answer is very easy beach


not even close
listen to anyone who
you otherwise
you
got any good al pastor


what i miss most about not living in



gold is pushing up against those former
from
after almost a decade of zero progress you can see the serial
here is that finally going to change in


f



not little
just angry
are you sensitive about it
can you imagine if
actually break out to new
one day is that day coming in



gold still
down near
after breaking down relative to both stocks and the rest of
gold can t keep up with either
f



ha i actually rarely drink beer never smoked
thank god and my wife
doing laundry so i m
for
on these
no
beer
and laundry consumer
break out

nice
no the point is that the extended a nature is a classic characteristic of
which we already know we re in based on many other
and common sense
yea for me its short term extendedness similar to many other
of
that
the same message classic early cycle behavior
in the

the s

regularly close above its upper
band
sense that
seeing it in this environment
be
if it
just
all those other
suggesting that
in a strong uptrend nice chart
and
all that really

i even look forward to it
mean
here


an interesting take i like that
i bet you got at least
in you
well we
really be setting that as the bar now should we
yea but



too easy for me
are their too many
or is there a good answer to this family discussion and i got curious
how many classic bench press reps of his own weight should a healthy male be able to do in one set
where u at
oh you think you re smart because the
you own are going up in price


is it like this
consumer
are breaking out to new all time
which is perfectly consistent with stocks in general doing well it s when
are
that it
of a change in trend they re not
spy
yea she was the best one too
i think so
which monthly candlestick stood out the most to you in


is supposed to be boring get your fun somewhere else the market is not the place to get your
fix i promise you

just proving to everyone that
the first time they ever got one right it
that quite obvious
i
find any value in such an exercise
arbitrary


k wrong with everybody is what you
but if everybody s crazy you re the one that s insane crazy how life

you know there are
who will think
actually true

everyone
biggest lesson learned in

looking for the next

not sure who
this report more or
this was awesome thanks for the





not my fault that you think
a dislocation between the stock market and the economy
blanc de blanc
wow champagne and new monthly
today does life get any better than that

and rock
roll

to me like some ras
and champagne are in order
no one
what you do

i am

tell anyone but
a better sommelier than i am a technical analyst
this is the good stuff

me your address
send you the last wine opener
ever need to buy
everything up the past
quarters not
tho
the bond market
to agree that stocks should be making new
so that
it really hard for me to disagree



oh hold on i need to manage some of my delta
fortunately for the rest of us the market
t care what you think it should care about it s pretty great here are consumer
making new all time
relative to the much more defensive consumer


this is not a characteristic of bear

new post
in on the peanut gallery spy


no thanks
we had been bullish gold most of the year
what s your problem
why do you care what i think go back to your life and enjoy yourself





no way
ha

oh i
realize it was a
probability got it
love it mix in some
juice
you mad about it
thinking yes because all the other stocks and
keep
their
higher
major league baseball player but then i was told they had to choose me not the other way around
next year
one
small
as the numerator and the other
gold as the numerator
i think both home
and mortgage
go higher

thinking yes
no i actually count on their

i
despise anyone
an interesting point here for the ratio between the small cap
and large cap






only
stocks driving this


further evidence of strength in stocks they should outperform their
in strong bull
and they have been
all

i enjoy their
to the market
yes i have the data too
yr relative

nope gold can go to zero tomorrow it can go to a million
matter to me either way i just want to be on the right side of it



very well
almost at our target but
not part of this conversation
just a tiny little nothing asset with no global macro
gold and
are where real money
hope that

and for the record it s not my fault that gold is
new
decade
relative to the
i had nothing to do with it just pointing out the trend i think sometimes you crazy gold people forget that i really don t give a
either way it s not my problem
is breadth too good yea probably but that s just a classic characteristic of the beginning of new bull
what s wrong with that
fair


love that
for
it s been a terrible idea to own it instead of
stocks
we can anchor to any date you want it s still making new
decade relative

no i don t think so
are you not good at math all of
can go to zero tomorrow and it will have zero global market
it s an irrelevant asset one that s done well sure and likely to go higher but
no impact on other assets it s a nice story but it s mathematically not true

no
gold the serial loser
its now infamous streak of
this useless rock is now
the

relative to the
in almost

few
have been worse than precious

f


new under the hood report is out first we build a list of stocks seeing an unusual increase in investor interest then we overlay our technical analysis to find the best
both long and short
let s zoom out almost to our target
got a fresh batch of spicy buffalo
try a

from the

my move

only good if you like

to watch

ha now i have one in
at
house and one up north
if you know you know happy



eve the

rally
today and
forget it
end until


here are my
spy


the best both
enjoying this
beauty thanks to and much




this idea comes from our new


which
specifically on

market cap stocks we like
the
june




a good one
what you might consider to be
is not to market

already
upon the information they had that you
it
every day both legally
illegally but
happening
what we think is important not the half ass justification afterwards


how about
them in the
what s wrong with that
i don t know people are angry i m not sure i think they have

you
find that you tend to get lucky more often when you re positioned in the direction of the underlying trend price
the news
consumer
are working on their

relative to s

in over a decade
from
is a classic characteristic of strong
stock
which i m not sure if you

we
been in
spy
this is a great example of the type of thinking we want to avoid
these breadth
historically occur near the beginning of
not near the end of them this one is just another example to add the list we
seen many of them the past

suggesting we re much closer to the beginning than we are to the end spy




pretty stupid
t it

i have charting to
without
them how much you enjoy the charting
yea
many people have purposely
price
this year in favor of other
why would you do that

no

you from si
you

for

how is


a good thing
we have a new scan of small
b w

billion market cap before they join the
to
club we call them the minor
we want to catch them before they get
up to the mids it s a cool list of a

the struggle is real below the

extension of the

consolidation a decisive resolution above that could spark the next leg higher
new post the

rally

spy


take it up with the index
i have no say in the matter

is not a tech index it s the

we re
specifically to the technology index



and
are not in
they re in
or discretionary
this week and i discuss what technology actually
considering



dash
represent
of the technology index they re not even tech stocks so what even is tech


out to new all time
this
goes long the
retail and short brick
mortar
baba grub
w



there are
doing just fine capital
in particular here is the capital
index breaking out to new all time



the best song on the new album go
premium monthly conference call video recording


i think we should maybe a
preview what do you say

yea it was fantastic and then
were hit and we were fortunate to move on many never did

there been a worse place on earth than treasury
what a terrible place to have been
i think a big one to notice is the
out of
today which is consistent with higher stock
in general not lower

spy
here are the supply and demand dynamics i m seeing in

i could just picture

saying this word for word made me chuckle
when are they not

i got today i truly think
will be more interesting than

i filter the world to only see what s working i m all about
for profit and joy not misery and pain when
about the
of
in
and


full video coming up shortly

spy



no that s not how i would draw it
the

extension of the

consolidation
to be short term trouble for
thank god that
t true
friendly reminder
the

actually
around

stocks but did hold

when it was first
in
so we re just going to keep calling it
for fun
happy
ready for a great week start by
out the dow
non ferrous
index breaking out of a
year base
this



period

the
remember
the last
trading days of the year
first
trading days of the new year as yale
taught us

ago


should fail to call
may come to broad and wall

i love how
born frank gore is helping the ruin their
to draft good looking out my man

been covering them since

not that exciting
just another asset we
have to treat them special
there s more to

than just here s a look at some of the other
breaking out





the
scoring against the
on a hook and ladder just made my

oh
happening
yea
take em


agreed
why we use multiple
to get the whole story
have a ball
price is never misleading
the only truth we have in this world
apparently not locked down from
german stocks



te

mas
yea





wut
wait til you catch us after a few
at the bar
i was a teammate on sports
my whole life got my
busted daily by older
got
up to varsity as a young sophomore
then college ball spent a decade on wall st now i get to laugh at those who
offended by everything every day
winning now


just no barrier of entry to drawing
on
on free charting
like there are in similarly difficult

well you


to analyze market behavior they just make it way easier and most technical analysis is terrible in the same way that someone who read a book about flying would be a bad pilot or someone who once read a science book would be a terrible surgeon
not exactly what the u is known for but still really excited to watch these two on

sweet count me in
match whatever
down buy a duck let it defrost and then call me
walk you through it its easy

thanks
you too how those
going
i have a new duck recipe for you



agree more

her to sleep
used to
of
and
yelling at one another all the time so peace
quiet
work for her
my
month old daughter

music
heavy metal

agreed to give the baby what she
dad
without even getting
at

well said
i have no horse in the race my team
their

yea agreed


dame in the
is probably good for business but
quite obvious that
dame
no business being in the

drink



just math
yea that was a clean breakout
t it
next

the path to
million with a little help from big
good luck

i don t but you re welcome to
yes this is a good example of what
look like and how stocks behave when they re in one

platinum
higher for precious

speaking of not in


that s hilarious



mostly
he becomes president because
got
of these saved from when i was a
mint
which people
time
right sentiment in gold pretty
huh
glad to hear it
i know
you want to piss off gold

stocks don t only go up i see
month bases
higher
a huge base and a big base but bases nonetheless



and




people get so
by




yea
mostly probably fry up some potatoes for the fam
who
follow through

the most important sector in
maybe earth still
t even gotten above its

come on what kind of half ass bubble do you call this


there s a common theme going on here


working

s

are breaking out

but failing so far to do so
gold spy


and here s a short term look at running into the

extension of the consolidation since

x for more
on
here s my explanation

step back and observe the breakout from a
year base


yea you get what you pay for in life you want to move to
good
help you pack the
the people in
the better as far as
concerned
try it fantastic

obviously
ha it was midweek and i have a
old cut me some slack
ha

i know
the worst
rendering duck fat and ripping through new weekly

with the assist

my favorite
proximity to
napa
and
and if you can afford to live by the marina its not bad living
is it
valuation analysis is hilarious

are underweight cash first time since

of an early stage recovery similar to
after the


and the
bubble



off the top of my head i can think of some really stupid times to have been long gold
spare you the many
we could be here all day

have been going up
have been falling
tell me this one
t look like those

iron ore is making new
year
what s that mean for
market stocks

f


i just don t always have to be long gold that s just stupid
nope we were bullish most of the year until our upside
were hit a few
ago just been watching ever since still watching maybe just a little closer now
red resistance green support
here we re
the
in equilibrium between supply and demand for silver

and silver
exactly
here s one for the gold
if these gold mining stocks are ever ever ever going to finally do anything you re likely going to see
in these key
and they d represent some pretty epic
so this is what we re watching





f
this was a good read nice job

here s a closer look at the current consolidation taking place within an ongoing uptrend
no the opposite
yea zoom out you
see the trend is up that s what we re following
when all this is over
just go to japan i know is down
i
really know what
taking about but
down for the
part of it
i
care about that have you found some decent
yet or what killer
in
tell him where to go


good eye
ha is that the right example to set for the
drunk frosty over there melting away

i do not bad for a

right hell of workout building a


i love when they think one
anything to do with the other



bases
doom


people love driving around all day looking for red

been there too we all have to learn eventually it
some longer than

interesting look at gold
more
for the stock than
i
even know what they do
the only thing gold is not making new relative
against is
so that s not saying much new


new



i
been hearing the word thrust a lot the past

more so than any other time in my entire life
the latest
to
club report just
we re looking for the next
billion
slab
sail





spy
and there it goes take a look at the

so you can see it took about

for demand to absorb all that supply this time around next target

here are the
from yesterday
is that even
around here

believe it either is this what that was
good times
time i have a
mo old and work
yes but it s a
and i work and have a baby so
s
it done but yes




good choice welcome to the fam

fry up the chicken
batter before finishing in oven
coconut flour seasoned
vodka sauce
the least amount of sugar butter and olive oil fresh garlic in the egg wash game over
chicken
tonight
irresponsible not to go


again

is it like this
imagine listening to

you should stay then
ha the joining in on the
fun today
these fantasy gains you speak of are
somehow not
to use those
to pay for
do they need to give the money back i
get it
good take
the
i
get behind but on this one we can be



a pretty sweet deal he had there in japan
sign up for that
yes we did

it was also the future

ago how d that work out
now let s add what
been one of the best leading
for technology and see what s going on in





now




you d be

they tell me that the market is due for a correction meanwhile
s
sector just went down for



what do you call that
why would i do anything else
if we get relative rotation back into

how long before they start telling us that
only
stocks driving


set the over under at mid

value line breakout
some

the

extension of the

consolidation is



they keep knocking on the door the way i learned it was that the more times a level is tested the higher the likelihood that it
is it coming soon
x


good look at the difference in behavior between precious
and base

no thanks
not a

i go straight to the source
small
are the most extended from their
day moving
in
the last few
that came close to where we are now were in
and
both
just after significant bear market
and in the early
of new bull

i just bought half a cow
told
a thing news to me but then i had to buy a separate freezer for it holy cow this is a lot of meat did it to save money but
like more trouble than
worth am i doing this right
have these
of
in the city



all time
in the middle of a pandemic

level
stuff



yea me too
thank you so much for the kind
you have a good day too

and plow baby bring it mother nature
here s a look at a bunch of the u s

one of these is different than the







these
are probably going to be pretty important



if rather compare
to
by cycle


like an arbitrary
though why
and not

or


why
naw


were also the stock market



was when risk peaked all over the world us stocks peaked global
peaked

since
here are the






yea i would agree that so far it does indeed look like a bullish consolidation
know if when it
out

well to be out and patient
see how long that

nice base here in lemonade since its
this summer

they re not they are set perfectly logarithmic scale


since getting back to those former all time
from

ago

been
sideways through time
to the downside through price sideways absorption of supply
downside price correction breakout imminent or is it going to take a while



right
risk management
was just thinking the same thing or worse


that was a great football game
maybe i
know about all that i just focus on supply and demand
no more demand for the stock than supply
the stock



only interested in the stock not the company


hey days


from



new to the court of
but my understanding is that the
whose
were chosen for the


that as marketing
they
be pouring much grand
either
i think

skip this
preseason and go right into regular season
should i feel guilty about that no right
well there are a lot of tech stocks but
not my job to categorize them i link to those you can take it up with here hope that

i
left bank
i think which is more like what
pour
not

exactly
the other
were a
from the

and a
noir from
de
those were my
anyway
never know
this was one of my
on the blind tasting portion of the certified sommelier exam but then
tell you which

you had they just tell you pass or fail so
never know left bank
for tonight


if
is below its



not an asset class that
too tiny no one with any money can participate
which story do you want to tell
spy

hi jack i don t know anything about you or your
so i
t be able to tell you


i d say the
de

vincent





south
bin


y






di


st














d




la







a very thing to do i like it

of the

are not even technology stocks know what you own stop grouping any company that
a computer into the tech sector



dash

the
is a measure of the premium
for at the money
for the s

that s all it is let s not turn it into something that it s not forget the correlation it s a derivative of a derivative of the asset in question i say focus on the asset in question



but neither of those are tech stocks
dash what do these have to do with tech

right before a historic
for stocks
ticking what top which part about all time

it looking ready to reverse yes i
checked the



when we re
whether to invest in stocks i think it s important to consider the
how are stocks doing relative to those these are the potential
we re watching to see if they stick or fail spy


gold not only
breaking down relative to stocks of course but it can t keep up with
either not exactly evidence that it s setting up for a decade long breakout to all time

like the opposite of that actually
f



maybe but how is how much the company
relevant to the stock price


out to new all time

sense


japan any way you want to price it


here s how


since getting back to those all time
from
which was also the

extension of the entire

consolidation my bet is that
t a coincidence and these
of overhead supply will in fact be critical moving forward

champagne baby
i do
but can we keep the movie
i like it
the fact that it

is hilarious but
not wrong
when my change up was on i was tough when it
t quite often good luck




new
in stocks are regularly
by new

i once got back to back home
hit off me at

i might be the only one
they say
are the
of the

think my
can make a statement today against the
or am i

big
to


only because
not in it
love it

who else is watching the
hurling final
about to start
go



those are sweet dude

it
the top

with plow not messing around
the grind below overhead supply
we re about to enter the
week of this churn how long will it take for demand to absorb all this supply the
are working hard this weekend finding support at the

retracement of this consolidation can they do it
now do

was
ask you the same thing


it in for the season and you still
it at home
at

not quite but next season
be

think i could get her out or not yet

yea easy
drink

anything from

in
premier
or better and you
miss if you must drink
from
make it
coast or

vineyard is my move
for thanksgiving
hell yea dude
get out together soon
these are all
you learn in the blind tasting world most people can smell and taste very well but just
have the vocabulary to explain it same in the stock market
pretty funny how many
i find
hey

up



hard
defense was a no show good for them they
it more
oh yea
a thing i
make it up
what a tremendous treat for me today
up this gem gift sent from a good friend out west
old muscat from
incredibly aromatic but bone dry gorgeous golden color

with age wow amazing
probably i have no patience
the worst
so
what big j
do
big
would be

and waiting for the breakout no doubt
will do see you there some time
wow
cool
love to catch a game live one day
totally hilarious but we
have a say in the matter so if
going to be
the

important to know what


how i see it

pretty
about
all
hurling final
be
for
my

lost a tough one in last
final
yea probably but that
change the fact that most of those
stocks have a zero weighting in tech
base
continue to be the better
and not gold here you can see copper breaking out to new
month
relative to gold base
precious



f
f


tech








right where does

number come from other stocks added too

not up to me to define but this is what the
whose job that is decided
the
part is that the majority of
stocks
even in the tech sector
seriously me too

even in the
which is equally weighted so

across the board not just energy based

like anything else
on the
right
and it s not just an energy rebound gold is struggling to keep up with the equally weighted
index as well
f
not
of leadership the opposite actually
and there they go the evolution of a bearish to bullish reversal price
t lie your conspiracy
were hilariously wrong price told us that shame on you for
it kudos to those who chose to see what was right in front them it
t that hard
me too


been hearing that for so many
from and
it s probably just a huge coincidence that stopped going up at exactly the

extension of the
decline
new
year
for
and a monster base i was taught that we want to buy

not frowny
what do you
think is this breakout for real or just another false start
and if you re wondering why the yellow rock is
such a hard time keeping up with the performance of other
just check it the
index getting back above its

gold can t keep up

f
the breakdown in gold last month
seeing a series of lower
and
downtrend for gold relative to both other
and stocks so gold s not only struggling
its peer group but also

which have been a much better alternative since


new
year relative
as
and
both break out to new all time
on an absolute basis
new correction
as
its

this month the churn and absorption of supply
how long will it take

well you cant calculate either of those without price so
not bad company on the
category barely beating out shout to the
crew
deal
could get ugly tomorrow
approve
i mean seriously who
watch
with less than




what
you think they look ready reverse what about the

see why we ignore this kind of stuff
like getting last
weather who

barolo and weekly
too young to open but
too old to care

bull or bear these are worth watching
the
might even get
this time
this one german company
a ring
really

a perfectly normal characteristic of bull
is that some days stocks
go up in price in fact sometimes
even fall and then they resume going higher we call them
they consist of higher
and higher
go back and see
pretty consistent
ha we

about it hard to do we just take it as it comes
sorry to disappoint
it
just like the other

you can call the market anything you want call it a bubble call it unsustainable call it aunt
for all i care but if you re one of those then this is the chart for you

of a market correction in
chart
spy



i
let you know can t force the data it comes when it comes
ha it
no weighting in our process just fun

only
stocks that are driving this



we
my life
my college
are
me this morning
if stocks are in a bubble probably further evidence that
not
ether was a diss track by

forget
i also know a lot about baseball and

but no one
me for those
win em all
i guess i know plenty of people who understand each of them incredibly well
a really rewarding journey and to share that with
is even better many people understand them
both great in my
maybe you should try one or both happy to help

also a certified sommelier people pay me to drink wine
a sweet gig too
telling you the art is in getting people to pay you for what
doing anyway what a country
people voluntarily pay me to see the homework
be doing anyway whether they
me or not no one
to do that they choose to and
happy to let them why
i
now do silver
while you may be right about tech

is a discretionary stock and dash

are in the
sector regardless would you agree
best to just ignore
and focus on price itself instead we found it really helpful
i agree re

who


admit it even i was
at just how well supply and demand analysis
worked in that market

is such a great case study for technical analysis
handsome alert
here s a good one worth watching as

break down relative to stocks
spy



here s the one that
the bigger

will former resistance turn into support
who

the difference
data
and
relative to the rest of

i wonder if all this demand for building
is evidence of growth or



what could go wrong





been
worse
of all the gold
and anything that
to do with precious
this is the one that
the best still below overhead supply from
but
to press against it if you re one of these people who

gold this is the one to watch as a leader

we
see how low it
my guess is i d most likely buy a breakout but if we get back to
then we
buy it there worked well last time patient open minded don t particularly care either way
nothing but lower
and lower
so far in since getting back to those former
this is what we call overwhelming supply how long will it take for demand to absorb it all here are some



supply and demand just like stocks and

nothing would make me happier than to take you up on that
every
i generally root for whoever is
against
in most sports but this
i can get behind love this
i
need wine for those just bearish
to draw
on
too much acid for shellfish
into it too much for me
crushing it i remember the early days of him covering

very well he would always appear at
st
day way back in the day too good times
family coming over for a bunch of shellfish tonight my go to for creamy
from
is a nice

from
approachable price point too especially
to cost of the


with it try it out sometime and let me know what you think

probably both



when i post a chart of the
breaking out of a
year base relative to gold i get angry gold

me why i
t adjust for inflation that s my favorite i can t get enough of that one



looking forward to seeing how it turns out thanks for
me


virgin galactic
da moon
we like the



bull call spread for


small


which
we want to own click this link for the full video
we should invent a currency you
see touch or use and charge

for them
well bring out the protein
this is a hard concept for people to understand but once you get this it will help you forever
thanks for the invite watch til the end to get the password

o


not rotation out of tech
rotation out of
cap in fact small cap tech and mid cap tech have been going parabolic which is the opposite of


what
look like

h t
crushed relative
you know me too well
very nice can t wait to come visit
that s
we re happy to bet the opposite way if when the data
that s the best way to proceed it obviously
t

good
i bet
treat it on its own don t overthink it
can t own it if we re below



happen much
for new assets go look how many
stocks had in the
they came every couple


we know for a fact that demand
yet to absorb this overhead supply we know that this
t my opinion these are just

have you
how those who chose sentiment over price have gotten it wrong never choose anything over price never
here are some

i would agree that is my highest probability outcome as well but we just don t know so why guess happy to keep waiting right that s
us very well so far
this is what an overwhelming amount of supply relative to demand
like both

ago and the past few
how long will it take for demand to finally be able to absorb all of this supply

quarters
never
consolidation at former all time

lower not higher and they tell me there
t more supply here than demand and this is all just one big coincidence my bet is it s not
sector market cap
international rotation




worthy
i will be calling you for advice one day my friend
no croze just the hermit
easy
from
the perfect
for shellfish
well for that you want a big fruity wine right i
think of a bigger fruit bomb than a slutty zinfandel from
ca
perfect
how it turns out

been on a serious northern
kick lately

hey thanks for the note always log scale regardless of time horizon

true
the best one is that
are much
than
but the truth is that if used properly
actually the exact opposite
man i wish some of my favorite

you see these

that s a name right there
new post stocks

are pointing to higher interest
do you agree

hit
month
copper
gold regional




new

for rising
new
you tell me
new
report just
this is one of my


clean chart

you see micro s only
stocks driving this market
not sure which one
me more
need more size on the
in football or
cautiously
for us which
worse
now do the bond market

that part of the
on our

hilarious big
to the

double the price to feel less ratch

stocks and
stocks respectively
equity market is also
in higher
here s that
chart overlaid with
for rising


willie with the hot chart
oh you
know about the high correlation between
and


not to mention the

that keep pointing to higher
copper gold ratio
regional


like the weight of the evidence
pointing to higher
in


credit

new
also pointing to stocks



nice chart
you sure it s not the
yr
themselves that break lower this chart
right up your alley

classic quote
glad you

the strength in
the past


t come from gold
obviously it s been coming from
look at this breakout to new all time



mail time
today s charting
happy

nice piece on about sentiment and contrary
worth a read getting some love in this one
and here s the
short term
min chart so you can really see
below overhead supply since


you can see the supply still coming in and overwhelming demand regardless of the reason this
been going on for a couple of week now check out the long term chart showing supply
demand at these
for the past



up
no
here

now do gold
i agree with that not sure what
so upset about
price is as perfect as it
what manipulation

you see i
found that ridiculously expensive

to get more ridiculously expensive and rarely
to be
it s usually expensive for a reason feel me so we trust price and leave the denominator alone
self driving

tech

yea but you don t know there s fraud until after they don t tell you beforehand so to your point none of it can be
it s all
price is the only truth
no the opposite i know for a fact i m not
than the market that s why i have to focus on the only thing i can trust which is price i can t trust anything else
i wish

me

i think you just go analyze price
going back

and around the world i think you
quickly recognize what s important there
re p e
why would you dilute something as factual and beautiful as price with something as trivial and arbitrary as an earnings estimate i never understood that
no i think this chart is useful enough thanks we don t dilute
as factual as price with something as trivial as earnings
hope that

i think they just mostly hate themselves it probably
nothing to do with gold
you mean learn to play as in pressing the play button


getting ready for another leg higher
yea maybe but
seen zero evidence of that

not a
in gold in fact we had been bullish almost all year then our target was hit now
not our problem
if when it
out again then
buy it back why would i own these

in the

so short gold then
likewise
yea because then i get these angry gold
telling me
my fault
losing money in their
but i have no control over their irresponsibility i
know why they get so upset


enjoy your dust
buy the breakout if it ever comes
not sure why my patience
you

always

according to who those who
been long enough
great again as long as
are below overhead supply gold is your problem not mine
happy to buy the breakout above

your
can collect dust in the

not my problem

not that funny just more supply than demand if when if finally
out above the


buy it in the

someone
problem not mine
if you say so i see a useless rock below obvious overhead supply

to your conspiracy
i
hold it against you

historically a great way to

for sure
fundamental analysis is for
no useless
for the record
happy to buy useless
if i think i can sell them at a higher price in the future
just not now
lately those who have been short gold
so
i specifically
to the inception of this fund and
not bearish gold in fact we were bullish until our
were recently hit i
care less what gold does
not my problem

you too


is also fundamentally

a rock there are no

who said gold is dead

what part of
less than ever relative to
is bizarre
just
grade mathematics

bizarre about it
why are there more
at this price than
i
know i
care either but there are
no
not right at all
why would it
no
made very differently
stainless steel those
are

to
comparison
why would i do something so stupid

is no where near all time

is just below all time

your point
is below overhead supply
just broke out and is above former supply what are you so upset about
to you

have you forgotten basic
grade math
got it so since you think
because of of central
do
have to give the
back

is great for
afternoons with the fam
so how do you execute that
your
with depression are not the responsibility of small
maybe you should see a doctor wish you the best

probably happy to buy the breakout but how long will that take i
know
how long will it take for demand to absorb all of this overhead supply so can finally move on and start a new leg higher after

of zero progress
here s a
min chart of so you can see how those
all time
continue to be resistance there is an overwhelming amount of supply at these
relative to demand that s a fact so how much longer will it take for demand to absorb the rest of that supply


you
see near


more experienced than me
you tell me do
assets historically get more over valued and stay that way longer than most expect or they regularly reverse quickly and correct that valuation right away
the gold fund

never been worth less relative to stocks so if gold is about to start to outperform it sure
a funny way of showing it for the record none of this is my fault and i really don t care either way i m just pointing out the trend
yea but can you eat

in one sitting
are you a
here are

to ask yourself
oh you were actually one of those people who thought the market was being driven by just
stocks

happy




is your obvious choice with the speed
have as

win a couple national

then be

overall and
get to enjoy it all in
go get it
exactly
i
remember
but it was bad
i like that
i think you have me confused with someone else
when i was younger i would fight
a lot i was that guy always betting on mean
then over time i
how stupid that was i was a
in early
i admit it it was a great lesson that will forever help me we all have to learn somehow
being fluent in

me in
for sure
not so much and
may as well be mandarin

feel like euphoria to me
this one time
and i got
off the floor of the
stock exchange because we were looking for

during an
ceremony we were
to be there i don t think they were too
about it though
i
want to get too fundamental or anything but this
to be bullish for weed stocks right
dude i
will the thrill get him in there

running the
internally worth
any
ha nice
well i
with some sake and
then
on to
marinated steak with spicy green
so went with a german
now back on that northern

now that the
are asleep


and white
i brought the ladder in and everything but the stick was long enough

new to this home ownership stuff with like a real house and family and all that long ways from a studio apartment in

for sure so anyway
out the old plastic fork on a stick trick to get the
up that high i thought that was pretty good no
well we did and the former
were our target close to
move now
someone
problem my computer will make all
of funny
when
time to re enter i have no idea when that will be and
not
sit around waiting
thanks for the shout
s
p

record high as consumer discretionary stocks bust out
well those are relevant assets
is not

no global macro
because no one with any money can be in it too tiny so this chart is for actual assets with real
hope that

no
only
on the
making new

yea i don t think it
much time either but the point is none of us know just how long so why must we be in such a rush to own something below resistance when so many other assets are already above resistance
last year
and i went to
looking for


i m waiting for the retest
i know i know i want to like them
bad i m just not there yet send me some
you like
exactly why is this not as obvious to other people
not like
some giant secret
yea i studied it extensively when i was
for
wine scholar exam but
found anything i really love maybe the
like you said
get into the

no matter how hard i try
i think we can be
willie
well
obviously i need to get into
more not into the
any

love ya
but
not
i
what the hell that is but
not the community
built over the last decade
their version of
i guess good for them if it
them happy but
not
i
feel bad for people who purposely ignore price
i

not evidence of risk aversion
happy national
day these are the
we need
just pointing out some common sense not looking for anything in return besides
pretty confident
disagree with my

pretty basic supply
demand dynamics

gone back and done the work this is a classic characteristic of
go back and look
find this sort of thing
quite often in bull

love it
well last time it was here it

so there is obviously more supply here than demand the question for me is how long does it take for demand to absorb all that supply another week a month couple quarters never
happy to wait and own other
in the

who do you believe bearish
or the bond market
i probably
the cause here a bit
ha just get me northern
and
happy as could be
yes both
of mine for sure but hermitage
it to another level
some would argue these stocks are

hermitage is the
of northern

my goal is that you invite me to those
and
bring the wine deal

nice risk
reward setting up here


technical analysis is just
this is where i bring in for the assist
no
now
just a bitter gold bug
be serious

only
stocks driving this




are too

i hope so
are a great time to make a lot of money

too much uncertainty in the market right
as opposed to what
what about the

of no progress for most us stock
in the case of em or
closer to
or

zero progress could this just be the beginning and not the end like the gloom
doom
keep telling us

since august good times
every month we get a fresh batch of monthly
it only

times a year here are some
spy
ice







the problem is that second one such a laggard always late to the party and then to make
worse
to stay too long after the

looking for slump

thanks yea number of twitter

anything
interested in i post
of stocks breaking down when there are stocks breaking down i
force something just to try to make angry
happy i hope they stay miserable actually
the squeeze
fun

more like lack of equity commonwealth




do yourselves a favor a run through the stocks making new relative
or close to new relative
these are the worst stocks in the world and they don t look bad i
t short them

where they host the

possibly the best sports experience of my life like nothing

video from tonight is now up thanks for everyone who
us live the recording and

are now available to
premium let me know what you think
tell me how you really feel
did the bond market finally get the memo this morning that stocks and
are pointing to higher

here s the equally weighted version which had already broken out

should we be betting that this is not a breakout from a half decade long base

this
came to me so many
ago hungry and trying to learn as much as possible you
have no idea i
be more
of his growth and maturity
had the pleasure
a front row seat to all of this i
wait to see
next good luck

new post betting on a greater fool

gold edition

like a challenge

both speculation
a useless rock the other is an almost useless currency only reason to buy either is because you think someone else will pay you more for it in the future that can be

it can be
speculation both are
on greater

nice find

look at this motley crew miss you


can correct either through price or through time try to guess which one is the more bullish of the two
stocks will fluctuate
if you just
one stock
here s

in a row for you
as yogi
said it s

all over again



anyway here are silver
running into overhead supply we call this resistance that was former support back in

before breaking down in

si f
how old are you some of you act like little school
gossiping about what random people may have said on twitter i don t understand why any of it
to you go spend time with your family go help someone go exercise or go do whatever you want to do live your life
imagine not getting anything accomplished because you re so busy worrying about what other people are doing on twitter that
so sad go worry about yourself go build something stop worrying about what one guy said or what you think someone else should have said who

copper
yr monthly


exactly like that
overhead supply came in right where it
up

ago that s probably not a coincidence
f

here s a look at the relative strength within the tech industry
notice how much

out since the
peak as well as the
peak
you see this
breaking out it
up on our under the hood report this week


after half a decade of zero progress the equally weighted retail index is now breaking out to new all time
this is not evidence of a bubble it s pointing to this just being the beginning of a new bull market
you see these
monthly
holy



did you ever think you d say wow finally the large
are catching up


hex





just think about how bad it is for precious
that they
rally while the us dollar is breaking down to new

tech
been up it was
cap
that took a well deserved break small cap tech and mid cap tech have already been breaking out and
that was more of a market cap rotation and less or not at all about tech

so i was thinking about the perfect wine
for new monthly
tonight since it s
i figured we keep it light and go with
noir the question is from what country and w german
going out at new all time monthly



it is

big news everyone welcome to the all star
team we re all very excited make sure to give her a follow huge addition to our squad welcome

new under the hood report just
remember this is a weekly list of stocks seeing an unusual increase in investor interest then we overlay our analysis to find the best
long or short
notice how s


peak until
after breadth tops out and breadth just made new


new update just

wait to dive in
how much better are
nights knowing you got fresh monthly
waiting for you at the close

technical analysis of financial
believe it or not
yea new
year




nice
almost nonexistent
it was a long spring summer and fall
for sure
you can add the global dow to your list of
breaking out of
year bases to new all time




a nice estate


not even happening in the
front office
as my friend ralph
to say how do you go back to

after you drink hermitage

great
but seriously bring back the beard

the
tho
no one
and we
expect them to
not helpful to waste brain energy on it just keep doing you
worry about them lead by example trust me

deal worth up to

million good for you bam
now
go get it
leading

been seeing a lot of breadth
like this

are super net long


have one of their biggest net short
in history
the s

just went out at an all time weekly
high so did the
stocks only advance decline line meanwhile we saw more stocks hit new

in
on both the new york stock exchange and the
than
seen since early


nothing to see here
during here s an example from
this year and here s an example from
hope that

i see
within ongoing

higher what do you see





el
is el
de las

para dinero
if i were you i would not spend the weekend counting all the new all time
in stocks

and
because it s
take up most of your weekend
thanks yea gold is making new
yr
relative to the
i don t see any evidence yet suggesting this trend is not down
i see former resistance turning into support and a break out to new all time

other people tell me the stock market is disconnected from the economy and it s all the fed s fault i only care about the first one
i wrote a
page report on gold and just
it yesterday i lay it all out
i

that they re only misleading when they don t tell the story you want to hear
fresh
month
for gold relative to the s

and just to show you how little interest
have in
these useless
all this weakness comes as the us dollar index
down to new
year

i see
out of
year bases to new all time
what do you see
i believe
was the
word of the year in

that right
i miss
my epic pass
duck you
is that what the report

oh yea sweet home
against a basketball school really setting a high bar
ducking
how could one possibly manage risk by
price
irresponsible

this all just a
story
sometimes

yr old turns around and

old man why
you sit down and let me tell you about the original big


me tell you about a man who lived long long ago his name was



just think about how much upside is left
so for me
hard because i like work a lot which is the only reason it
me if i
like him i
care but i expect better
we need to iron this out maybe a
or something but we need to discuss and clear this up

around
the thing is told a room of

that if
an investor and your advisor
in technical analysis then you
hire them the kicker the firm who
the event
technical analysis every day in their




not for the longs
the only thing i
learned from those
is that they love making bad

gold just made new
year
relative to
stocks ouch that s
hurt stocks over

to be the trend
one day you and me will be in northern
with our better halves and i
show you
so i should have just gone with the barolo instead of the


almost as if there was more demand for those stocks than supply of them

that were going to zero and it was the us dollar all along

are what we like to call

no
not sure what salt

to just taking
when
are hit


like the specs are the
that should be worried

zoom out copper gold ratio is the one to follow for
no divergence there


this chart is like watching the new york
play the new york

terrible



how do you
stock

here are base

precious
the way i learned it from almost

ago was that from

come fast
in the opposite direction

that one line

me more that you
ever know

well as long as it s in a book
you see commercial
holy

only been this long one other time
oh yea do you have actual data or just a hunch

been
my
on
here for half a decade

yes


life hack
for lunch on thanksgiving is a great way to load up on some protein but still stay ready for the big show later in the day
welcome salmon tuna

for me today also skip the sake go with a cote


patience will probably keep paying well here think about the opportunity cost
else can i do with this money
if
is below
then i still think pretty much anything else is a better investment almost anything

a snap


bull call spread
no
what does one have to do with the other
yes i do know that which is why i m
you
what you think
alright
which one is it
i m

boom


i
t know this until after i
the certified sommelier exam had i known i probably would have
sooner

notice how stocks are breaking out of
year bases relative to both gold and
stocks have made zero progress relative over the past few
they re just now starting to get going this is just the beginning
spy


even

and
are breaking out where does that fit into the bear thesis

on another level
you
even know
all good yea i
do most of those

do no stress with
i enjoy

more than thanksgiving football
and
always is boring agree with end of year time

boom getting some love from i like it
yea i
disagree with that was more so just
his question as to why
prefer thanksgiving

prefer football
basketball
is
days maybe thanksgiving closer to

people stress themselves out

for
thanksgiving they just eat and drink weather better thanksgiving and everyone
regardless of their religion
thanks

the band
over here




politics and economics price is so much more reliable
not even close and two of my
as well
and too you and yours thank you
probably eat too much if
go as


very nice

chard

no way
thanksgiving ready



for those
me about thanksgiving wine
i put this out on yesterday s
and if you re not on my
list make sure you get on
happy thanksgiving enjoy


bullish



good luck man
julio franco and



you
have rational
with cult

the thing

to both and
in
this is great
you think the gold
will win one day or naw even back near all time

still serial

been a rough road for the gold religion for me like

just
i
really care whether they double or go to zero
not my problem
you
think snap is ready for its next leg higher if it s above
i see no reason not to own it
i just tell people
a plumber i learned that from
nihilist


i
walk myself out
no
to be clear i think
goes a lot higher but it
t matter what i think our
were
pretty lofty
at that now we wait and
as we get data
was our ceiling now we only want to be long if it s our floor we
see how long it

it s a
post not an article
imagine saying never sell



to everyone who made money in
this year remember you don t always have to be long and it does not have to be
in any special way it s not a religion it s just a trade target
now it s someone else s problem

precious

a look at the performance of
this year

fight papa


it was already
in the roaring
i can only imagine the times that
market is
in for the future

who is we

i

historically you find a lot of this sort of thing when stocks are in


let this be you
thanks well just take
when our
are hit that
the most sense to me
which

no
hilarious
too soon
so what are we extra sensitive about today anything good i can get really upset about so that i can be distracted and not get anything accomplished

the


social media and

the stubborn
who ignore the data get hurt the most
awesome

i have no idea what
talking about we analyze price
not sure why any of that other stuff would be my concern
if
only looking at large

missing the big picture as all the smaller sector
are actually just now starting to break out to new

i think
just more concerned with
other

since theirs is already shot they
possibly be that bad at this there must be malicious intent there somewhere

check in on the
who are now
to

everyone forgot

is weak sell stocks
also

is too strong sell
economic
at its
observe
learn from their
best thing we can do
support yea but how many

can he do




nice chart
no according to this they do not
big
to the

yr
for reading so many
good for them
i like how even the
who they can still con into watching basic cable know that
are stupid
small cap tech mid cap tech and equally weighted tech all breaking out if your world
around only large cap technology stocks i think
probably leaving a lot of money on the table here are some


funny baby
are the only
they can still fool into watching basic cable nice post here from

international
day so since big
is from
which is in
it
like a classic
is most appropriate and since

old math i think it only
sense to go with the wine aged in oak the
my
is

nice zoom out
what if everyone
and
anyway
is that pretty on brand you think
the
are the least of it plenty of money to be made in stocks going up outside of large cap tech
the scenario
been in sideways
with expansion of new

you trade the
you get average
is how i learned it
we know international

so what
seen rotation back in since early summer
impressive for sure even



even
the worst of the worst
i continue to see more and more
throughout
and
breaking out to new
on an absolute basis which is further evidence of breadth improvement
relative strength is something completely different
thanks for that based on our work
from international is not a lack of participation it
more to sector rotation the banking and natural resource exposure and lack of tech outside
and a few other select
is quite apparent
ha this is fantastic
no
good i like something
tho
a


preferably get that lactic acid going for the
fish
curious where you
are seeing narrow breadth we
seen some of the best breadth of all time sector rotation market cap rotation global participation where s the weak breadth the data
quite obvious that it s the opposite

since it s international
day here s a helpful guide on how to find the

statue in

they don t make it easy so i did
probably just a coincidence


new under the hood report just
first we build a list of stocks that are seeing an unusual increase in investor interest then we overlay our technical analysis to find the best risk
reward
long or short here s this week s list
as semi s break out to new relative

both the overall market and technology specifically here s an example of a mid cap semi breaking out that s also in our
to
club




if your employer
about your

already lost


right
happy international
day best gif ever
i have no
i
know what a double negative is
good talk see u out there
there should be a picture of
in the technical analysis encyclopedia under relative strength



spy
see i always found

to be useless and impossible to manage risk so
always found it to be a huge advantage to ignore it altogether regardless of the market environment or asset class in question
these

perfectly fair to me respectfully i
agree with your thesis
i don t know anything about the world being in great shape that s not really what i m interested in just looking to buy
going up that we can sell at higher
that s all
just right now
very nice

all night it was a good night
sauternes



ha maybe if it was actually on international
day and not a week later

getting off my
slowly but surely
thank you
a lot i honestly have no idea that stuff is way above my
can you help
i care about my family my health my
helping people college football and good wine the implication of market
are the last thing
concerned with
find favorable risk
reward
and enjoy life how about that for a strategy
gold can double or go to zero i
care
not my problem
can double or go to zero i
care
not my problem pick any stock it can double or go to zero i
care
not my problem i
care at all why would i

ordered and

yea definitely we actually do a modern dow theory of s

semiconductor index
dow transportation
more like five above


classic
yes i know it well i don t even think it s in his top
most important

just
the data come in as always and keep
what choice do we have i m a slave to price
so is this not a breakout from a
year base
it is to this bull market
for those keeping track at home that was the highest weekly close for

relative to the s

since the
week in

spy

we
been long we got
covering it in early
i m in i just don t need to ignore risk management because i let it become my religion
not just sector rotation we re seeing market cap rotation


spy





it s probably much
if
is not your religion for both the mind and the portfolio
i
get the mute why not just block
the point of showing any mercy
the benefit
breadth
ahead of the market interesting perspective from this morning


new all time



album but with the national symphony orchestra great charting music
talk about a load of crap
livestock
tell em willie
yea she s right it s not bad
not pizza tho here get involved

a casserole at best not pizza although i do
like the pie crust
probably not on the list of bearish


remember when small
mid
were
no mas




do it


because if you become part of the cult then you lose the ability to think clearly it becomes religion there is no risk management with these people
scary
should be
no differently than other assets identify the risk take
at
same thing
the thing is you can be long
and expect higher
and not have to make up conspiracy
about it
no reason to be a one trick pony

is no different than
a stock or

just
and math

is dangerous

the best place to order wine from around the world

not long probably
my new hat for on
just came in thanks for
this on come join us at


great cause
this
sake is some of the best

so reliably

june

bull call spread
is that what s going on here in


the
list of stocks to ever hit your stream just
are you looking for the next
billion
look no further
so are you
tell me this not a breakout to new all time
coming out of a
year base for one of the most important stocks in the world

some
polarity for you in the ether

x

let you know when my high school
start
me about
again they came at me hard in late

i

from in
radio silence since then so far not a peep
friendly reminder


fair
don t change the subject
you re not

not
put a beating on

come on

key
from last night s conference call
i remember simpler times when
meant you
the


by a copy
paste of an old tweet when
meant your tweet also got sent to when as the
call it now was just a group of
in soho talking
good times
this is great

house is

big party next
international
day

i m told this year s
are going to be huge as big as the previous two combined


the
and the

gold
are still stuck below overhead supply how long does it take for demand to finally be able to absorb it all

the video from last night s live monthly conference call premium is up with the
of the
to
as well
except with better
and not as good of food


is aggressive
this one
just like those other
right i m not just seeing

they re not

behind the


the wine biz

we lost this
vintage
of






what are you doing to celebrate international

the fraud

that was a great weekend of football
yea

when japan was making those
one park in
was worth more than all of the real estate in the state of a
combined
been to that park
fine i guess
it certainly

yea but because the fed is printing it
count

but the


never had fed printing like this


on low volume

will crash soon because of the pandemic and economic crisis

are too high
a bubble

new
the
report just

this is a list of stocks that are seeing an unusual increase in investor interest then we overlay our technical analysis looking for long and short

this
list
considering corona beer
fell after the virus
spreading this
surprise me at all
nope here you go
got it also that economic crisis and
pandemic is probably still a secret that no one
about yet and
priced in at all

a very
thing to say
if we re above those

this is a buy all day tur
the most important stock market index on planet earth just went out at new all time weekly


the way i was taught was that you don t fight papa dow
the


index
out to new all time
on the back of higher turkey demand due to more smaller
at thanksgiving or maybe it s just that there s more demand for their stocks than supply it s one of those two for sure happy new all time
turkey
go get em
it s probably
be like this right historic breakout coming for

believe
true at all but thanks for the note

market sense and nonsense
a chapter in there about what he
the
market

a good read
meanwhile
are paying
all around the world to teach their
about the efficient market hypothesis and normal
how many
do we need before they stop
my bet is that there are enough of you who put ego over
that it will keep making my life easier as time goes on go ahead and bet against me
people who think
been in a bull market for a decade have already lost
when i get
about p e
i just
understand why anyone would ever want to dilute something as factual and beautiful as price with something as trivial and arbitrary as an earnings estimate
like
orange juice in your champagne what are you even doing
i really appreciate this sort of art
here check this out
when
are hit sell when the market
you wrong sell

should have no place in market analysis

quality of life
for me
ago when i said
to the
day moving average forever and stopped watching daytime basic cable television more music and

on my

the simple
my

overthink it
the ability to change your mind when the market
your thesis to be invalid and more importantly first
what the market would have to do to prove that your thesis is invalid

breadth thrust i think yes
their bond
probably
i mean
just so used to taxing their own
for so long now with such reliable and consistent
that they think
should join in their misery as well of course they do
not a downtrend

this
is so good and so fun to watch
tawny port

even be ranked after this weekend
welcome to the best

of the year spy






still watching
oh
work with a bunch of fundamentally
people who always think price is

that s simply not true
legendary technician

d
up to his old
once again what say you

i was at this game
was incredible


what s the over under on how long it
for a pop fly to hit a drone during a live
game
you
see these
stocks dive inside with me

spy



new
to
club just
if you re looking for the future
billion
you
find them on this list
yea or naw

everyone
my favorite body of water is the mediterranean after that
the fountain in

park

full disclosure my wine
is actually filled with
sake
judge
if we re above those

in the i can t make a bearish case




there s juicy premium currently priced into the snow

strike
we re selling them
oh i see
breaking out to new all time
and no one is talking about it
nope
our new young
list just

that pay you to make
imagine if
of consistent dividend growth and high momentum
relative strength had a baby

not one of these
watcher people but tonight

through why do they all look so depressed across the
is it always like this
yes sir great juice
what are you drinking tonight i m thinking something


is known for some of the highest alcohol
in the world i d go with
valley in particular a
cabernet blend from the area can probably work too


this

chart
short it


new video big
monthly w josh brown

this is where
and i go over a handful of the
that stood out the most during my monthly chart review
well at least you have a large sample size of prior



once went on a mission trying to find

mid
since the s

peaked

ago not so much in growth

h t

us stock
being
up by the strength in leadership
like
and energy
a breakout in the black one would be constructive for us stocks heading into final

of the year
spy
blessed
the
with constructive feedback keep flooding in
we got some great feedback this weekend on the
with who
his
on you can listen to our entire episode here where mark
how the stock market is not being artificially
up by the fed
thanks for the note and thanks for coming
consumer
have been serial
since march as
have generally done well running into a key area here in the

ratio
new under the hood report is up we create a list of stocks that are seeing an unusual increase in investor interest and then overlay our technical analysis on top of that
after another year
and napa cab still my favorite

then
w champagne
by peanut
w tawny port
the list

next year
ha no more
left in the house

the
is going quite well so far better than it is for the fox intern anyway
when the guy with the highest career
rating in college football history
his first professional game for your favorite team you drink the
best


there s more supply than demand for gold at this price that s not my opinion that s just been a fact when demand
finally been able to absorb all of that overhead supply you
know
f


the
love it when i have bullish
to say about the
but to be clear i m not part of the buy
blindly with no risk management cult those
are no better than gold
from june re the
breakdown for a little history
for those keeping track at home yes that is in fact a new low for energy stocks this cycle



there s only been one other month in history where
closed higher

remember that month that was
my high school
were
me about which
to buy not if they should buy specifically which


are bank stocks and treasury
finally starting to pick up what copper
gold have been
down



f
f






people have been told that if the fed is printing money it s getting
in the system but that s not how it works people don t understand the mechanics of the fed funds and how it s a closed system give it a listen
every time

delta you take a swig
how many
tho
my favorite


i know it well

got a nice vintage tasting lined up for
eve
going with dry creek valley zinfandel from




get involved call them and ask for
tell him
sent you and
hook you up

check out my latest
episode w special guest who was nice enough to take time out of his beautiful days in southern
to talk about boring stuff like stocks gold



and of course the u s dollar

is what
when we let
design

treasury
are mostly down on the week in case you
t

classic polarity and
year breakout or massive whipsaw


wow that s actually pretty awesome
is it like this
yea
good you have my approval
how of you


the
is a mean
vehicle not a
asset so while


some
are helpful and

just like anything else you
want to look at the
in the new
high list when s

is making new
mo
for example
well for me
the
in any way is technical analysis because the information is the behavior of the
market for s

right so yes but i think would agree trend

classic
and stuff like that are no good do i have that right at

more supply than demand for it at these
same as


you can extend that philosophy to

and it works very well too
oh

t
out that far ahead that is pretty convenient i must say
new
and new
tomorrow
mean does it get any better

what do you mean by relative strength

this is how real work
done
mid cap
hit overhead supply

spy
evidence of risk appetite or risk aversion

rather just be bullish
because we think it goes up no different than
or
this spring or treasury
in
we
have to make up conspiracy
about it just following

better for the soul this way wallet too
i see what you did there

the relative strength

this chart is lit
the big advantage technical analysis
over fundamental analysis is that it s compatible with risk management where as fundamental analysis is almost inherently not jack
author of market

false start in
bases keep






making new
yr
relative to

ex north

if the
index fund is below
then it s hard to bet on a bull flag more like a mess probably

it was easy i was just throwing alley
the whole time

is the opposite of fancy more classic and simple than anything else
because when i do it it
like
doing something wrong almost naughty

twitter how do we feel about
in the
yes or no
one of my favorite


side
green


with garlic
olive oil
it with a
from chile and some chicken

what if that was my
strategy

with the sweet
setup the analysis was pretty good too

and legend with the assist
somebody
say it
my point is not to dismiss
in fact
been long and expect much higher
my point is we
have to make up conspiracy
about its global

because
such a tiny irrelevant market at this point that could change one day

just
knew the movie reference well done sir
my interview w jack
we discuss everything from the market

to technical analysis and what he
to as the deficient market hypothesis

a bubble it will end badly but a lot of money is made during
and
usually last much longer that people expect
does it matter
in a strong uptrend buy it

in
should be trouble for now clear skies to
if we re above that but patience is probably best here until it
out
social relative

so how did the s

do afterwards last time


on
comes on at the

mark
the continued
from the smaller cap
over their large and
cap
spy











cheap candy
not really
go wrong
you want a
wine


napa valley cabernet
might be my
wife bought the candy early this year husband found it paired it

cab
trust me


only need one a in gap the
as usual
their
need two
in their
and it needs to be in all
too like if their screaming it at us



a sweet chart

equal weight
already making all time
so yes
only a matter of time before the cap weighted version does too

is a
security stock
come on our radar
sweet base
the latest under the hood report is out
looking for a list of stocks seeing an unusual increase in investor interest then we overlay our technical analysis to find the best risk
reward
long or short




that
sound like a bubble to me more likely a healthy consolidation as
rotate and plenty of room for a new leg higher
i really like the city of
and the people there but i hope they lose every game this year
like being short a stock no mercy i hope the company goes to zero
some
might be going sideways but more stocks keep making new




yea i agree i do the same i mean people i never want to hear from again whether they did anything wrong or not maybe they just annoy me and i
even follow them but comes up on my stream just block them not worth the mute to
point
this is a selfish endeavor to learn and share and meet like minded people quick
for

even think twice about it out of your life forever
good for the soul
are for
not
go big or go home
this coming
we get new weekly
and new monthly
i love it when that
and


st
night pretty pretty good
i
known all those
for a long time i
been here a while i
never had a
account people have serious
it s quite obvious

serious question
worse election twitter or
music in



the most
punter in the country
funny because
never get any love but if
an
team

is the guy i want
the


always bring a smile to my face
the lesson is to get your
fix somewhere else anywhere else really
back of the garage


and a bunch of other
we still
gone through it all
old school
said box
so my father in law just found a box of old
this is a serious find wow

lucky that i
have to care whether it is or

why do you care
i can t help that some people are insecure
could be
yea why would they
it s not so much of a debate and more about who can be more sarcastic than the other
they keep saying blame china i m saying buy china see the difference


ben did you just call the bottom i mean
i guess we
see
new
yr
for the


divergence


how about these

the same week stocks all over the world are breaking out to all time
advance decline
all over making all time
i like how they actually
it out for you in case the fat chin
t scary enough chaos fear contagion
you mean right after this gem
some of my favorite

can you think of a better one
could it be like this naw yea could
actually show
of life if there was ever a place for them to do it this would be it

shall i remind you of the
robot
the day before tech peaked and

robot

make that up
the
are bearish trump you know what that probably
right

thinking yes too by the way we saw the exact opposite in

before any

even

are breaking out to new

does this prove your bearish thesis wrong again or do you
just short more here

new all time
for the
most important stock market index on planet earth is not bearish especially coming out of a
year base
did former resistance just turn into support and now we move on

teamwork
the dream work

work in west
or


still very common in ski

listen all

make wine but it
mean they should
i bet that
from

more than my


i like to think about what
are available locally when choosing what to pair so considering
comes from



a grilled
make perfect sense it does to me salt pepper fresh garlic fresh lemon less is more
call me old fashioned
yes i get it shut up and follow the trend stocks are going up but i think it s important to understand that yes stocks are going up but also recognize the when stocks are going up when they re not supposed to buoyancy support demand whatever you want to call it
here s how that worked out over the following



which are historically the best
month period
in a similar way to
stocks did well during this period in
i d argue incredibly well here s what

like during the worst


you see we don t actually sell in may and go away that s stupid what we do is we look back at the period and ask did stocks acknowledge seasonal weakness or was there enough demand to support higher

if you wondering whether or not stocks have been resilient throughout what is historically the worst

of the year here is your answer one more week to go before the best

of the year

probably not as good of an investment as the

the answer was yes
is this like the


analysis
have to be complicated analysis

financial
breaking out probably because
not a financial and actually a tech stock
yes just the first one tho
for you
who are new to this


actually say anything but it would be cool if it did probably some great

did we just get a foghorn reference

is red white and blue too
i agree with thrasher

di
for me
are you the train conductor
a quick chat with about


which one is more important to you no wrong
it s just about what
you happy i really
this one
to
ha nice
someone
it

a


yea



be batman for
you
maybe you re looking at the wrong stocks
love that
if
were to see this i bet
be call
on the seasonality aspect and tell me to focus more on the actual trend itself and would be standing right next to him agreeing and
when i go grab another beverage

still
with the resiliency in stocks during
worst

may
h t and the
election seasonal weakness pointed out by this weekend at
i
just shutting off twitter and stop talking
after i learned of passing but i know for a fact and all of you do too that he
have
that at all my bet is
want the opposite so
the best chart you saw today make him

anything but a zoom meeting

true

sorry
here are some of the great times we had together over the
he was the best
so you mean

naw you
bring your own
the
list of stocks ever put together our

to
club just
are you looking for the next
billion company this is probably a great place to start big
to for the inspiration to create this list
what bubble in stocks
nice tribute video from the crew at thanks for
me in this
always a good time with we
miss you
literally a rock star
legend


ago with
s infectious laugh
rip to our brother you will always be a special part of this community thank you for inspiring all of us
i like the


is that a breakaway gap in snap above
gap n go

weigh in
how do you think

will do in that environment
interest
not completely

to me that the world is not completely falling apart like
being led to believe we saw the opposite at the end of
which clearly pointed to


selling stocks this and then are very different

the
component of the

index
is making new all time
the




are too baba

matter but when you see one buy it a lot of money is made in those
way more than the
trying to fight it
for sure
oh
a thing this is our
to

report from

ago the latest update
tomorrow
if i
most of you how much wine
drinking from
it would almost unanimously be either

or

trend change or consolidation
so not



our weekly look into the life of the intern i like this one nice job

to be able to afford

i
see myself ever being fully retired i love this


shorts probably should be

a fact

its been a helpful chart for sure

hilarious
the us stock market
remember when

were a natural
play
top
today
group

semiconductor
electronics technology
consumer
jeff
seasonally speaking how have stocks done during
worst

of the year have they acknowledged that seasonally weakness or
the market been resilient enough to ignore it for me
quite clear that
the latter
this buoyancy is characteristic of an uptrend
i have no idea what
talking about
send
all day be careful what you ask for
no matter how we slice it a lot of these market cap
are at key long term
which could end up being potential inflection
in the primary




spy




more green
in the first one


here s your modern day dow theory not exactly in

early
i was
just getting into little league totally into

and

the latest under the hood report is up remember what we re doing is
a list of stocks seeing an unusual increase in investor interest then we overlay our technical analysis on top of it spoiler alert this
theme
to be

hey check out my segment with at this weekend s event to help raise money and awareness for breast cancer research


spot

a breakout in the black line would be supportive of higher stock
as an asset class it would mean a breakdown in consumer
relative to the s


spy

shut you down

did you say may never be broken
wow very nice
coming over

introduce you to some
you can trust i got u
the
not wrong
wrong

a good idea
will

well if the shoe

my future
are depending on this guy
thanks for
us it was a lot of fun twitter

not too late to donate
we have a biweekly note about exactly this we call it the
to


a cool list
drink from the



hip
guess who
up to the virtual conference today straight from the mean streets of

if you don t use
now is your chance to learn all about it from the best there is
our boy talking inflation
at tune in and please donate
it s not about the fed it s about whether the market
or
seasonal
that i m most interested in
interesting how well stocks have done throughout such a seasonally weak period very weak period h t at
heat




join us all day today at coming up later this morning we have rock


i love what we
been doing in
the past few
if
stocks are a market interested in check this out
yes i have i just
believe
necessary to do those
in fact i find them

there is tho
thank you and for
me
mostly the trend but then yes relative to
and momentum and yes always relative to historic price
i was
about

yesterday my answer was that i just
understand why
dilute something as factual as price with something as trivial as an earnings estimate
rather focus on the numerator
the only part of the fraction thats going to pay us anyway

actually the opposite

morning slack
from the intern
this is fantastic
you tell me but
suggest it s more like all day brew

did you get a chuckle out of yourself there
who
about the economy that s not our problem
feel me


haven t made new relative
since may what s that all about
spy
yea tech is their

sector after

consumer

sir
a lot
big bases
is it like this
so is it like this

stocks with good

this bubble chart
the story
just east of

find

where they produce
di
some of the most tannic wine in the world it also
set you back like a napa cab or
from
does much better price point
a
that was straight juice


had all the potential in the world
in case you
t seen this one in a while
spy
i thought the
had potential i really did
in the latest edition of
look our intern in new

fun of college football and on my own
i can t possibly allow this can i
you know how you know
getting old


guess who i got to drink a whole lot of wine with me today
been pretty hard core into the northern
valley as of late pretty happy about it
naw if we need a plural we call the
jay

the response to last

was insane we
the room up for everyone and i
through exactly how and why we built the
to
club we re looking for the next

check out the video replay here
so where it was

ago
going over to

an
and rarely
gem of a wine the
grape is grown in a bunch of slate
granite
found in this part of
y
that we call
go get some
thank me


the on

strike
for

or

time to get on this one

what i said about crude oil
so what do we think about this
here s one from the
to
club
coming in at just over
after graduating from small cap to mid cap status and one day potentially a large cap

and beyond


stay strong playa


for production just
version most
have their system


noir why not
a little
and i like that about


yea if you like their chard try their texture label call them and ask for
tell him
sent you also any of the
noir from
valley is fantastic ask for the
vineyard the
and
format stuff is great for thanksgiving

both
and
told me today separately how were already doing that

a good idea good for them
ha said the exact same thing to me
today
of the big
team sports
basketball simply mathematically they have the

on a team in the league

and what not
here are the
for

me too it s amazing what a helpful supplement it is to all the other work we do


we call that breadth expansion

only a good thing if
long

i use them across


for the win and
year old math with the assist


what could possibly go wrong
meaningless to you maybe
nowhere near the
bubble

the
is up an average of

on the day after


the


they always lose their best
by definition

the operative word here being

how do you calculate those
hey thanks for the
this is cool
these magazine
can be great

i mean the economist literally
the top in tech to the date
this year they even had robot

i don t think it
why it s just what s being
with stocks breaking out to all time

these were magazine
over the past week and they went out of their way this time to make sure you are really
they even wrote the
out for you blood chaos fear these were
the same week that the s

advance decline line made all time

interesting dynamic going on with stocks breaking out to all time
yet this is what the media is feeding the public blood chaos fear contagion the dislocation between sentiment and reality can be a really powerful catalyst
as yogi said it s

all over again

it s only large cap tech that s driving this market

after
at a very logical level are gold
now ready to move on and go retest those




therapeutics
a recent graduate from small cap to mid cap status breaking out to new all time

are chemical stocks and
part of this state you speak of what about the transportation index
and breaking out to new all time
does that fit into your theory too
all is right in the world
wow
pretty terrible first world problem to be clear but epic fail no doubt

and the
nothing but respect

the s

advance decline line making new all time
by definition the exact opposite of showing weakness
is anyone else watching this
game who are these


from the intern this morning
perfect

important truth do very few people agree with you on
from
yea thanks me too

is good i appreciate their hustle
sunshine is pretty good i hope for him that he
get
by the


nonexistent
i feel bad for people who ignore technical analysis but i feel really really really bad for people who
follow college football
you would think there would be more vodka
nice good to know
big game barolo for the tonight
bet the farm
i
believe i have to wait
more

any



bout
we turn to for

big
to
s dad for the inspiration on this one
the young

that pay you to make

one day

coffee is a hell of a drug
technical analysis of stock

this is going to be fun some great
will be joining me
respect

so what
saying is that

game for the is equivalent to an
or
championship game meaning if they win they go to the super bowl


the first team to




a classic example of why i think your buck furthest in
and



the top
too soon
us wine is too expensive so no real comparison maybe
valley if you really
me


i think i need to put out a notice that any unemployed
always have a role with me
they did but the
are still great

which is why we let them continue
i feel like no one


looking at a delicious and very well priced
noir from
but this one comes from just southwest of
which
it some of the northernmost wine
in
get involved save some loot drink good juice

and they


magazine
like this with stocks just starting to break out to all time
is there a better combination for stock
buy with both
spy





i have a feeling
bring the
if the proportion is in the golden ratio it will equal approximately


protein


just passing this along from the
at with a nice little sprinkle of in there for you for those wondering what all this advance decline stuff is all about
this is
relative strength

going out to our boy and his family
been one of us for a long time and in all my
with him
one of the best ever and in so many ways we love you


just like

not a reader
finished my first book since baby was born over

ago
good
the over under on how long it
me to finish the next one






like a terrible way to go through life


just
winning
in whose opinion
where is there any evidence of a speculative frenzy i see most stocks around the world that haven t done anything since risk peaked in
in

land that goes back further towards


out of curiosity would you say that this is evidence of impending doom for the stock market or would you consider this to be constructive and supportive of higher stock

journalist
i
understand how can you ignore politics when


hold my beer
maybe they re looking at the
upside down or blindfolded perhaps new all time
is not a characteristic of a downtrend or turmoil or

with stocks making new all time
the media is telling
about turmoil not seen since

here s one that comes from the
list of stocks in the business
to
club band
the only people who
out in
are white
with sweater
and lost
eating bad pizza it s a convenient location tho
are welcome personally i think we turn it into a giant
course that would be cool


was a terrible place for a long time it s not
fault the pandemic just finally
do something about it no one
to go to
now no one can what can we do with it now any
or is it always going to be stay below
street city
it can be if you want it to be
i have no idea what you re talking about
is that why
and chemical stocks are making all time

where do transportation stocks breaking out of a
month base to new all time
fit into the bear case for

for a friend

it s weird that you care
our
to
report just
inspired by perfected by and i with a little sprinkle of and first the list and then the best trade
where art
science

not
fault that the
were tired of losing in the stock market and
on to something else

this is what you have to look forward to
yes fantastic
drink them older let it shine
all too impatient

murphy technical analysis of financial
easy choice
i do this thing now where
always drinking young barolo i have no patience to lay them down we need to create locked
with timing
that
let you open them until
ready anyway young or not this is straight juice
it could be secular and if
right it probably is

the
and

and
they all just
the biggest
understand that the least

there will be a bunch of crazy
outside
but
worry if you miss them
be back the next day
get a bunch of
de guayaba and bring them back for white house

well deserved rotation classic characteristic of bull

seen it so much before
see it again

as the s

corrected in

broke out of a twelve and a half year base relative to the
market it
logical the s

will follow
and the entire consumer discretionary sector to make new


spy

after any small correction in a bull market
new
not bearish
this was the crib for a few days big fan of the
this time of year until next time old friend
yea but where were those
before all those stocks

ah yes i remember simpler times when we used to take an afternoon cocktail and fun chat in las
for


on heaven s door masonite international the rule is you have to play the song when you enter the trade but then play it again when you take
that way every time you hear the song you think nice one for the good

that
is so hot right now


there is more demand for them than supply
goes to the upper right
this

the
report is out we start with a list of stocks seeing an unusual increase in investor interest and then overlay our technical analysis on top of it to find the best

that was some performance inspiring to watch whether
a fan or not very impressive evening
do you think
smith
the score
listen i love the best
and
classic
as much as anyone else


barolo
you know this but
tell you what
put up a good


with a little age up against any of those
nice
to

as a
fan i am very much looking forward to next

game


huge fan of the

my first time here in
found a fantastic little wine shop and some pretty epic

gravy at this breakfast joint in
the foliage is beautiful as well obviously but those


that


yes i am aware is blanc de blanc not
either in your world



so which part of
being made up of


it not


is a lot like a technical analysis if they tell you they
like it
usually rooted in a lack of understanding of what it actually is give this one a try and come talk to me
me too
and certainly not against


well
then


here s the video

from this morning s monthly chart strategy session premium

get my gossip fix elsewhere
very natural to want to story tell and gossip i get mine in college football recruiting and transfer
i encourage you to get yours anywhere but

it is
all over
read


then call me also not sure the grounds crew would appreciate my

with oil i would have said support at zero but that would have been wrong
no
no price action is forward looking i
care what people
about the
i care what people are
for the future
do you make up
to justify price behavior do you listen to made up
to justify price behavior do you ignore price behavior in order to have more time to listen to or make up
all
to consider
apple is never going to support flash



yesterday i was
by which was my favorite technical pattern to buy i told him i like to buy the
going from the lower left to the upper right i can t think of a
pattern
what move down

a snap


bull call spread

morning baby
go get it
thanks

better with

petite
actually
champagne vintage port


good
you re probably a great time at

i
know i
fried
as it turns out i absolutely love them
had
picked
instead of
none of that would have ever
feel free to send some love
i remember hanging with
the next morning and him telling me
i was in the train last night and someone actually

that someone turned out to be you
thanks for the note
coming stay patient
on me next time
in bali deal
love me some


video



what would surprise you the most this week i chat with about the
that he just
t think are going to happen what can we definitely check off also his dance
look like elaine

individually they get it wrong all the time that
matter
when
wrong collectively as an industry that it
our attention that forced

as the catalyst almost like a wall street analyst short squeeze




right you know

technical analysis
financial media a conversation w


consumer discretionary
money
to go where
been
best
great


are secretly justifying the new desk you want
if
are ever
get going
this be a logical place for that to start h t

not here to help you they only exist so that they can distract you
let them
your choice

anything but solar pretty much
first world

no way energy


price at the top of the chart
mean
resistance there
it
you human any other
would be abnormal if
interested

prospect theory

and


be careful
quite the rabbit hole
on


my
took me to the inaugural game i was
that night we went home and found out my
was pregnant with my little sister needless to say
nice to see them back in the

for life i
forget
do you really believe the global
did what they did today solely because of that
show last night like
in some kind of vacuum come on

better than that
most of the world
already been able to dive into their new monthly
we re the last
life s just not fair sometimes

make that happen
you know why solar energy is doing so well because these are not energy stocks they re tech stocks tan run

go do something today that
you happy
give him a couple
with me in

or
and i m confident his answer will be different
champagne blanc de noir preferably
the big mac trade today we re looking at a consumer discretionary stock this is a restaurant chain

the point is to anticipate these
expect them be ready for them
coming baby and coming in hard
so many stocks making all time
out there across all the most important
daily weekly
monthly later today this
to confirm the fact that yes we should be spending more time looking for stocks to buy
spending that time looking for stocks to sell

your market analysis gone to the dogs

gross why you doing that
we wait for the candlestick to complete before making



hey at least the

start tonight the way it works in this one is they get
for technical
when they speak out of turn the other team



health care diagnostics
pushing up against new

consumer discretionary
on both an absolute and relative basis
spy
yea because all the solar stocks are in the tech sector
energy stocks new relative
today

spy
interesting chart here
thank god for price analysis
if it s from the
i would
the infamous schnauzer formation in the

looking at
is way better than sitting through

how come these stopped going down is it because they re about to start going up or is this just a pause within an ongoing downtrend that will resume lower




here s part
of happy hour w
sector rotation edition the heat are equally weighted

it s always a party at my house when monthly
are involved
what s the one monthly candlestick you re looking forward to the most tomorrow night for me going in i think it s the dow
transportation
but i m always
by one i
t expect so we
see
here are some important
we re watching


f
great thread
high quality produced by good people
to have that kind of reception here


tell it like it is

not the election itself that
interested in
the change in seasonal strength this time of year that
our attention it just so
that the election
right in that sweet spot see
great chart by via
new under the hood special edition
new
decade
is not evidence of a downtrend

a nice ring to it
it
if i
a band

went out at new
year relative
last week
this is the part where you close your











how are those monthly
you were looking at

ago working out for you
know your index




these
like
to me what about you
i think the biggest
from this whole thing is that there are a lot of stocks going up here s one

oh
no
for
is there
so what are they

with today remember anything to direct your attention away from actual price behavior
their job mine is the opposite

the one chart that stood out the most to you this weekend

in
and get yourself
spy


thanks heat


have a
and just embarrassed
good weekend for the

thank you
a great time to be alive so many
so much to learn
go baby
i think it
sense to buy
stocks that are going up
a quick video about it
thanks for the shout always a good read
because i
need
at the bottom of the
to tell me where the volume is
maybe the best
you can spend for a warm
afternoon the
do it right slightly sparkling just a tiny hint of

no i look at it as evidence of risk appetite for


true
a ton of relative strength in frontier
which include classic defensive safe
like



and
evidence of risk appetite or risk aversion you tell me

tell you what to buy
tell you
is a bunch of

it goes in
they had their turn the world
on
are the same way

what a terrible place but is
even worse
one of these
is better than the other one
good way to put it
i disagree it can be used for good while
cannot you can learn so much from people on social make new
you and me for example get restaurant
when traveling

just most people are irresponsible

you give people too much credit barry they would rather have an opinion than have an educated opinion homework is a lost art but a profitable one

i like to think so i had about
of them today
by culture you mean
where they
give
place

here s what this person is
to


from one of the smart


not
in otherwise
so
with another all time high which is a pretty classic characteristic of an uptrend
my sister is on her way to my house with
s
and it s
if you know you know
there are stocks going up a lot of them here is the

going out at new all time weekly

again





work




do yourselves a favor and turn off those noisy daily
for

and get through some
i mean seriously
i agree not even sure who
would be
it
even be close

sorry sis you say something

for domination later
here s my
interview from yesterday







i
always felt that way maybe as i get older i realize not everyone was as fortunate as i was to spend pretty much my whole life in a locker room or trading desk
i can take anything at this point
most people can t tho
you can tell most people never hung out in a locker room or a trading desk they re so sensitive and so mentally weak what do you say we help these people how do we do that





sense
nice chart

dry creek


if i were hypothetically going on
in

what do you think i should talk about
the dow

index is quietly working on a sweet bullish
of the prior weekly real body

chateau
will have to wait another year bummer
he
does

are for the weekly

take a step back

here s an interesting look

relative to

ex north



happy
check out the reflation
upcoming retest


true but full disclosure i my now wife at a charity event over

ago then found her on
got the
the rest is history
month ago a baby girl
us too so i guess thank you
or just tight game

drinking

for dessert tonight so nothing but love
just drink the
stuff and call it a day
dude for at least a decade now
yea


while
definitely right
open minded
sure for the wise
if

drink
noir from

coast is probably the best place to find it then
yea i said it

key

you
are awesome the family is

what do you think is the biggest misconception about technical analysis

better when you like what you do

like a consolidation in an ongoing uptrend
awesome thank you
video happy hour w
the sector rotation discussion
just booked a trip to the
in a couple
any


are messy but many individual stocks are not
ladies and


get used to that name
did he know a green hammer is the name of a real
candlestick and actually a really bullish one or is that just a lucky coincidence i hope to god
the first one it would make me so happy

tell that to
board
champagne and

my life should be the name of a


is more gangster than me think i can keep up
us dollar

a



bull call spread
wait til you see
coming
but did he ride the wave and get back to his
mark or am i going back to the well too many times
wait till you see what it actually is you
laugh
always wise
from
these
are a lot of fun join us as we continue to think through the
for our
to



spot

does that mean they re flooding the market with water

if
is above
what s not to like

here s a look at the equally weighted retail index doing nothing for half a decade what
if this
higher how bad could
be in that scenario





y yuca
always a celebration over here





tonight going with
from
with some oak influence
near
anyway
commercial
have never

more than they did this month what do you think about that

and i learned it from the market punching me in the face so many times
which

the us dollar is not the one who won here

semis relative
but think about the advantage you have over everyone else just by understanding and being aware of this one thing
new video w and join us as we continue to think through the
for a stock to join our
to
club
probably
or

solar one of the
showing relative strength today if it s above those former
from

what s not to like tan
meanwhile first solar

at former
resistance is still a thing

run
making new all time
look at the size of that bottom big wide bases with explosive




them saucer



if
break out of this base relative to the market that s consistent with lower stock
overall
so this is an important base to monitor
spy
look at the stocks that are up this morning there s wisdom in relative strength
for me the bubble that
in the
is relative last time they were here
small
they
a long period of



this is a great chart the real story is at the market cap level
our latest
the
report is out

more trading days before the next set of monthly
becomes available

a
miss for you
am i in your top
favorite
technical


a good move for him i wish him nothing but the best
it
out so good then you lost me with burton
i
with that guy
did you even read the post






the bubble that just
in the










you re the first person we
worked with who is so particular about his

agreed


need to be
before making the first investment
why are you here what are your

what is your risk tolerance how much are you willing to lose
what is your time horizon how long are you trying to hold an this investment
the answer from a mathematical perspective is that sometimes
better other times individual stocks better
on the environment
not a right or wrong
a when and where you
brush your teeth with a hammer different
for different needs
that must be cool look forward to that one day good luck

dominated heat lost but still up

in the series
take it
where you at
text from wife and baby upstairs
i
know and yes
if
wondering what

when the are in the eastern
and are the college game of the week at the same time the answer is
which is probably my favorite

have a great
night everyone
my favorite


if you say so
right but what if we
care about the economy and
just trying to sell stocks higher than where we buy them


that


ago have largely
not true at all
nope

tonight
when you tell me tech
gotten
i know you
mean micron mu
are cool i guess if you really want to be lazy about it
more demand for the stock than supply of it could also be a positive catalyst

not tho

like a bullish argument to me
the longer the time frame the more powerful the shorter term the more noisy
the recovery


ago

no i doubt it

yea i
add any value here either
look at any of this stuff
this is what breadth expansion
like


not my problem
imagine why it would be yours either

the large cap
problem not ours
if you think gold
outperform
like yen too right
is it like this
year base since
that
higher a future member of the
club

exactly
so what does that have to do with

small
micro
transportation

all breaking out
curious where does money rotating into

small
and transportation fit into the bear case for
would love to hear how the spin that one
the most hilarious part about this whole thing is that i m getting
and
with victory
on the market peaking meanwhile i see stocks

all over the world breaking out of bases sentiment here is way off i think narrative
reality are extra far apart
another all time weekly
high for
this week not a downtrend
the
out of

some might even start calling this a trend soon
new
year weekly

for the dow
transportation average do you think it s all about to fall apart now






i
think about monthly
on the

learned that
a great way to drive yourself crazy
i know funny
funny

over stocks
thank you all of you for everything have a great weekend
this is one of my all time
mostly because of its history unfortunately
one of those



done
you know
of the time it works every

definitely


been going on
good
nothing

wrong with
stocks that are going up
when does the triple

launch
if
not then
know soon but yes

like a major change since


from the beginning and i
forget
ha great to meet and yes those were

not coffee
some
maybe
the best
of the day every day
oh
are
different
of people in the world those who are good at math and those who



true
hey question for my fundamental
which
education service stocks will benefit the most if that was indeed the college bubble

is it perfect of course not but is it better than ever absolutely and
not even close if
looking for negativity
easily be able to find it but from me
only going to get reality
i find myself
to constantly remind people that the world
never been a better place

key
from the market right now


de still does not care about your tech stocks
love that

in the casserole category at best

discuss like

come on
dude stop i
take you seriously happy
tho
does that make me chuck d or terminator x
ran into
on the tarmac
through the
hilarious
yes
how to do it
it would be a first for them
the video and
from last night s live monthly conference call are now up

of analysis and

premium let s get it
good morning good morning there will be
today and there will be

a group who is clearly not winning
already are
it was the wild west back then
i see u



or

not in my house
fair but still true qualitative is technical analysis not fundamental


log scale or linear

your geopolitical global macro moral or ethical
are about gold and its
about the us dollar the fed us economy

the only truth is price and price is telling us that gold is setting up for another run


sure they do they just do so with management

subscription

new post chips and
two nice trade
in here



pull up a chair and get a front row seat to watch this
yr old in new
go from just our intern to becoming the next market wizard


a team of
now from
different
around the world we do business with everyone from the
financial
on earth to
opening their first account if you want to be part of our team

ping me
at
dot

why do i sell my research well because people want to buy it
all over the world i have to do the work anyway even if no one
it so
be pretty stupid not to sell it
i for those wondering
my answer not sexy just common sense
the

made on this platform people
hired

been able to learn from and interact with make all of the
and
worth it thanks everyone we
do it without you
the cool thing about what we do is that everyone who
our research

days risk free and also
the ability to cancel any time so if
not for you no
at all
send you back your money we go home every night knowing anyone with us
to be here
you notice oil
never hit oversold
in momentum during this sell off momentum still in a bullish regime

great chart
thanks not sure what you mean by package what do we use
these

are cumin for new
i like them long above

for some reason people
like to hear this but
perfectly normal for stocks to go up when
in
we
have to make a whole to do about it
technical analysis is not just about


the behavior of the market and its
but it just so
that a chart is the best way to visualize those
in equilibrium between supply
demand otherwise it would look like this you choose


not wrong
you see this


pretty great
it

all voodoo
yea
not

just angry
a difference
not
fault that they suck
that s adorable quantitative analysis is technical analysis thanks for


the worst name

since
pizza kitchen
technical analysis
other analysis
amazing
hell yea brother
went cooler climate classic
move
do i go with the big boy from
from that hot continental climate or the
more delicate juice from
and a cooler more mediterranean climate
momentum in consumer
relative to the s


again right around

which is a classic characteristic of
meanwhile consumer

is a classic characteristic of an uptrend for the
stock market and for risk
the market is voting

seem euphoric to me
always a valuable report
yea there are a few different market
too

why do you always need to have such a passive aggressive
my bad
try to be less passive about it promise
this was fun check it out

i never knew i
one of these as bad as i do now
we will shortly find out if yes in fact you were indeed dramatic enough
hey man
no right or wrong this is a very selfish endeavor
doing just fine brother
no
a note from the intern this morning on
about a scan i
even know we had yet
wow so many good
this weekend they really do tell a trustworthy story about the demand for an asset i
imagine
any other source as a priority over price

sure
not long or anything
negative
already proved that
it
pro tip when you want to scare
with your

seasonality
you have to make sure you cherry pick only the worst
and then conveniently leave out all those other
that stocks did really well it works every time

there are global
to this rotation
seeing

pretty easy actually we just mute the obvious
trump


then focus on price behavior instead and
been a glorious social experience


nope


different
because bigger
should be
just above

and lighter
in the high
so unless you keep you house or cellar at those
then

it done
the
minute rule you put the red wine in the


before you open it you take the white wine out of the


before you open it
our latest under the hood report is out we start by building a list of stocks showing an unusual increase in investor interest then we overlay our analysis to either join in and ride these momentum
higher or fade the crowd and bet against them

yet they somehow find a way
your

looking at
upside down also works
told
is there a virtual sommelier or is there still a human element there
they are

and


is voodoo hold my beer
he probably
a chart or some wine in front of him
if it
go back to before
i
take it seriously
is it like this for the



so what if
is above last year s
what then sell it because you can t handle a bull market in stocks
to who
we re specifically
to the relative performance that


i know


holding in the
index fund


here s one for the gold

hey to all my
in
make sure you
registered for the virtual summit




regional summit nifty



get in free otherwise it s just
make sure you re there

the most important chart you saw this weekend

all i do every day is argue for what i think is right which
are you
to there are very few
involved in what we do
because i know some people
handle it and that
me
most of the stocks


even tech stocks

see how the whole
a tech
thing works out moving forward
we all have our
purple mine was amnesia in

when i was young and broke and sneaking into
in south beach and new york city i
wait to be able to afford
and
and invite all my
now that i can afford that
rather just stay at home with my family a barolo and some chicken


dude are you
me

is my favorite region on earth
this one comes from a very unique

igneous rock soil in

cut that out

prerequisite there i think
happy to walk you through a series of perfectly logical bullish
if

trouble finding one

not the

fault that tech
keep up
the
i keep getting
are about why large cap tech stocks are so weak no
at all about why
and
are so strong



row tay shun
you know who
t care about your tech stocks

good reminder from barry
all time

with


together another monster week and going out at yet another
year high where does that fit into the global slowdown story to me it s quite obvious it s part of
rotation among

industry
classic for bullish


so what
if japan finally
out to new
decade
what s that do to your bearish global
thesis that
not been
out at all



going out at yet another all time weekly

i m not
the flight to safety trade into chemical stocks


to me this is classic rotation in a very standard and perfectly normal bull market in

with the dow
transportation average up again this week it
just a fraction of a percent away from new
year

t seem like world ending type behavior if you ask me
but oil is not leading anything it s breaking down

we re at the highest
in a month for
relative to the rest of the market
spy in
we saw the exact opposite taking place before the market

were the laggard dragging not the leader supporting
the reason i work hard is so i can have more pizza and go to more college football

why
ha like i need a reason
don t miss the latest episode of
s what the
this is the weekly show where
the latest and

in the the fixed income commodity and currency
this week s episode crude oil
f

what are they
to do


so do you
think you were dramatic enough over the past week
fun
i never
a blackberry and cutting

me cry a lot
classic
a
breakout party i like it can you bring the ras

best song on that album

price
any backward looking economic data we can sensationalize this morning or did we get all that out of our system last week
go check out
giving your boy some love



i caught myself saying

tape the game
felt good for so many

a lot of
in this one is an up and coming technician
been following since day

energy too say it
so
so what
saying is plenty of room for them to go up before being at any real extreme buy stocks aggressively then

thanks for the


fun with financial

in his own way i think is telling you not to over analyze incomplete

how so
doom


want to you to see this breakout
welcome to the team grant
the best one my father

for
and made so much money so i m holding it

upper left to lower right no tech
no not really interested in that data
not much hockey in
or
so but i do love it go to minor league
here
i have no idea what
taking about

say water or sauce i used the sauce middle was cold even following
so just watch for that open a zinfandel from dry creek valley or a
from cote
both if possible
yea and if the energy sector had tech stocks in it they
be
either
my life is really just constantly thinking about my next

i like
good wine and game

i really


i think the world
it this is fantastic well done
new
get involved on your next
night
relative strength relative
