at the
dating back to

was almost
in

and is now around

i just
back to
and see same so shrug

i just see many use it and each time i wonder what is the level that we need to focus on and so i m

so i have a question about this metric since it is not one i have ever used what level is important
already beat you to it
quickly
by a



thanks everyone the alcohol worked great


i accidentally touched my sharpie to my screen and now there is a dot i can t get off anyone with an idea on what to use


i have one of
s buttons with that
excellent we were there
i think we
in
then
then
and the
river used to go down to the
all the time when i lived in
in late

a pullback from here on
might give a
of h s bottom no

remember last week when i said they would rally i
bet you none of those bullish on them today were a week ago because

we were there about

ago was like a walk back in time
currently is a non confirmation there is no saying how long you need to wait for one or the other to confirm it s all very grey
i won once with one of the

some cat name so then when one of their
came up again i said go with it again have lost every time since now

are on my restricted list

next time you should maybe stop and think before you tweet just

are you really
in monkey
i have been there
which part the non confirmation

step off the desk and brave the frostbite cold outside please try and keep it together while i am gone
nothing it s just showing that the stock
gone far
oh i don t know they have to double to go off the top it s when i cut and paste in advance
the off the top that i am the

shop went off the top so i had to cut and paste it
there is a book with that title
you mean does everyone who
it and said don t buy it at the
see

the feline
you want us to bet with

my drug stocks really act like crap

a million thank you s all the same wording too to him in my time line can you say

blushing
last chance to get your
in
still one hour to get your vote in



brad what time does your coverage begin and will it be on


for me it is basic geometry two
make a line the third
it the more
on the line the better the line i am not a



i suppose you might say that but also the length of time it spent under the line over a decade



also if you like a little heat try trader joe s chili lime on that rim for your tequila
not a one
may as well show you the

of the
put call ratio that last low is



now where it was late august h t

i post it every week during my chart fest
important to me one thing i have
though is that the

tend to like it ta
maybe don t understand why i post
that s all
to me
i would think any serious analyst does but i am old
they are two different

since


been to buy twice
i keep


shovel instead of roll the

me too we d go shopping at
s then to
s and stop at the automat in between



already been there done that come on
the
ratio
t had a double digit reading all year in fact the last double digit reading was

and that was

keep those
coming
spy
made a lower low

trading days ago was


trading days ago was


rut five straight green
t gone six since late

should have added the blue line for the

dying this is terrific thanks


this is terrific
i am not sure i have ever seen this before there are like no red

i write a daily column for with context and my
hope you will have a look
if i go back to

it s only
days

we like hard work
holy
volume batman in
net volume up minus down for

been red exactly two times that s it wow

was the
volume for
since

fan

for as long as i can remember

twitter poll the next

p


i write a daily column where i put all this together hope you will have a look

the
had the
volume since


cumulative advance decline line for

but it is heading upward now how do you know it will be a lower high
this is still an awesome chart
cumulative a d back to

keep looking dear jay

i suppose i tend to use it for direction not magnitude
so is it
or
divergence was a
for the last

so
what you see different now

chip love
not that i see what do you see
this was the week everyone discovered the


for all the
and
still a big giant sideways

the breakdown from the red line
quite a stir on

insider ratio

panic euphoria
to have done nothing this week
but when we look at the longer term for rate on

t this interesting
rate on ten year who
t see this line

summation index why yes that is a change



still a whole
sideways

err i mean




relative to
watching that
low

last week had a higher low this week a lower high
bank index relative to

bank index


right off that lower line like magic

channel check

channel check

the
channel check is back
good
morning chart

why yes it is squint hard and you can see it
been doing it this way for nearly

just
right to me

help me what is it i can t come up with anything good

trying to go off the top
low battery
i want to stay in this biz long enough to hear there s no more cash on the

never short a dull market is that what you re saying
maybe we should do a rut poll on
instead of

i always say you are
to complain once after that it
annoying so pick your time to complain
hah yes but
t mean i can t complain
honest answer and i m not being cute i am old been doing it this way for nearly

just
right
well i
been gone since
so i m an idiot
was a great base on the chart good looking
tomorrow s chart fest should be fun join us
if it goes over
by much i will cut and paste before
but i don t want to anticipate because then i am the
as you know

i
hold your hand i
hold your hand

plummer aka captain


i just


for a

at trader joe s


so serious
are you saying history

probably
housing
will disappoint too i m just always
that everyone
to be caught off guard by this
prediction for the

there will be a decline in construction
because of the massive cold front we re about to have and everyone will be
like when retail
disappoint because of when easter
i am not an economist and i don t even play one on

maybe he is a

guy



non

which is weird
and you
t tag on this sad
hello natty
it s breaking out of a base
i have always said until the
in
need a coat when they go out for a smoke natty
t care
every day i look at the weather on my
because they add another day on the
day forecast every day i look and see no relief from the cold on the added day how is natty not limit up
this was a good discussion
i work with a pencil and paper i dont
except with my

this chart of new covid

like the
chart
hey
here s another amazing one
tall enough
it
sentiment
today
thank you but mute
thanks i
t have time to look
i saw you note
once for a day a while back and the day was down so i
just ignore it it s more like seasonality to me i stink at it
certainly there is a high level of excitement
and it
to look for a rally this week so in my view it
been helpful
see my pinned tweet it s been awesome you can argue all you want but it
been awesome

right
rut
straight green get this
t gone five since may
just part of the routine
sentiment
today from a week ago
you are generous i will keep it in mind
you are sweet thank you
the latter for sure


would be full of paper

remember last week s decline neither does the market

we are not selling off into the bell a change
don t fret it is fine probably
t mean anything to you just know that she
t
a week ago that s the sentiment you need to know
don t fret

yes
she s
again
am already there
i am not on clubhouse nor do i have a
sad
who
t have a

also i look forward to this weekend s chart fest
serious question does tomorrow s
mean much market wise
net volume up minus down on

been red only once in the last ten trading days
paper trading
oh man here too and every day i wake up and see they have added one more day of it


the whole story was awesome glad someone else found it to be too

t that story something my
is




old but when we
in

ago all of a sudden there were



so many
were similar look at me i m just like the filthy rich


it really was funny
but
t been on
list in

it was their own guy who
gotten covid it is no different than the first time they had

ago when their own security people were
with the
people just my two

look it the us open and
open did a fine job the
decided to do it differently and in many ways made a mess of it
they should have had
the way the
did instead of
quarantine




open plagued with



ford on the top five active list been a while since we
seen it there

who let the air out i will be here all week

exposure goes down again this week now


i m
go with not as bearish as last week
nice
black gold
maybe i should auction my
chart off for charity
maybe

i would love to be able to see a chart of
from recently and
from
side by side
i have never
that before
are for

amazing
i am not believing it my grandmother would say the zebra
t change his

apparently
told her she needs to give her
an excuse to think she is

have used
s
machine for
and this one is just as lovely as the rest think i got this one in

he was like a value stock


have that look
can we just ratio you then


would have used it


bank index right off my line

no
that was really terrific i feel like macro
should listen commodity
rate
and definitely stock
who want to learn trade

joe and
are killing it this week with their
great discussion with jeff



costly subscription
there might be more

today in my
than
on

kill joy
you know i love you
but the blue line
like the better breakout with the retest last week at least to my old tired

mute the news

i like that
bank index
this week
they
t only downtown i had

in the
lived on
in those bath in kitchen

if
can make a comeback why can t going to the mall

you have to subscribe
applause
we re all degenerate

a reminder on
it got to
at some point it will get low and
will be a buy for a trade that s just how it works
my
is all about

i am so glad you posted this because i have been watching
and wondering why no one is
thank you
he
t but read on
queen scoffer here
ask
sec been gone for
not just recently
because we are not addicted to it nope not at all
like
the emperor
no clothes

new stuff being learned in the last week about trading today s password is

like so many
that were in place covid accelerated them
guess
s break from twitter
t last long hope it
t mean

to go down now
this should be added as well

yes
the irony that the whole
of trading came to a head with the stock
is something that if written in a script you d scoff at for being absurd
more
we need more

well i would say this week s rally
done that


barely

fell

the

ma of


up
dutch

wait is that like i didnt agree to be fired so i m not really fired
well when the time is right we can get together with and
oh yes
there
t many when i lived there

ago and i had forgotten about

oh yes i forgot about ralph in

t know it was in
he left twitter it


out your way now well maybe
i think
i saw
our
are in
did not know you were in


hurt his back so now i don t know
central

like that too

straight green for

t gone
in a month
nice weather that time of the year
we should go to
when this covid thing is done rev


i guess he should stop talking about the
moving day average then or maybe that s why he
t know it s day moving average not moving day average
should i delete my

he
if you
t

to invest you are gambling i guess i am a gambler
i do use it to watch the
not sure i have
the
stuff but they put a
bug on
a while back
hope i wasnt the
for


we haven t closed at the high since



i saw pac and thought
i need a vacation
so many look at
s
when was the last time we closed at the hod
egg

be sure to prep us a few days before so we can arrange it
supply is the issue not demand not right now
we can have a twitter fried egg party

s

would that be the blind leading the blind
took a break

left twitter and



would like that
it s the lying that
me like it s become
to lie
ouch stay warm
starting

the weather in
starting
is

good analogy


huh would have thought they would serve breakfast all day
it is

people with
should go first the problem here is that people are lying about them on line and show up and don t have them there is outrage
yes
are an issue so they should go first the point is people are lying about them
you mean
are everywhere wait while i get my
face

is neutral so not sure why

t ask any


we had a whole list of them
and you
to insult me
the put call ratio
been rising all day that
not been the case of late
first i know you are trying to be funny but
really
t funny
hah true

hi
it
been on every questionnaire i have filled out
when will you realize that he is not only chair of the grievance committee but also the attention getter committee i have told you this time and again

there s a big uproar here in
re people lying on the covid vaccine registration
saying they have


which
them at the top of the list
does he chair the grievance committee now
when you are this close to a gap you note it often
filled down below would be what i care about if we get down there
filling last
s
gap
like a crime family

roger sitting this one out
they never have
and it works just fine first time i have ever had to wait longer than


pretty good
if you ask me

s
buy
for his
this is a joke
top spot
second day in a row

t in the top
most active
everyone
fine
when you start then they play lift the rate every single year thereafter
that would make me happy
hah yes
he could go toe to toe with

now that
is
the
job i predict a future headline jeff

a

there are not enough
we need more



for all
great just
there while i do her
each day no
thanks for

oh gosh i would hope think so thank goodness no
here
so true
i m in my car so it s fine they have never been an appointment vet maybe too many are no
not sure but they seem to operate pretty efficiently and keep the
down
i m sure they do so many pet
out there


actually it s a great service i
t have to sit in a waiting room with dogs and other people got to sit in my car and listen to a

is great got her annual
she is a trooper


they open at
am at

i was in spot
i


just for them to call me would have no trouble going public in this market
took my cat
to the vet today first time since covid no
first come first
they have
parking
each with a
code u scan fill out a form
they call you when ready for them to come fetch your pet
hah like i have special


hurt his back so not sure
another excellent discussion today





or the


tear

i predict a super spreader event sadly

us too
also we live right across the street from which probably
our place desirable to some
sorry to hear some of it is that
need
to do it
change pretty to very and i m right there with you
why i chart by hand
it was very cool because it was their first factory outside of
ever this was

ago it was not an organized tour we just
up and they were happy to show us around was a great time to be in china
no but the
had a flashing r if the stock was restricted from employee trading
every single day the local news
a story with a headline just like this and every single day it is the same
story that it was

ago come
you can do better than this nonsense
when i lived in shanghai i went to the new
s factory there for a tour we saw them make
out of hot rolled steel was pretty cool then we got to buy them at deep
also pretty cool
i have seen much chatter on it and i too find it curious with no explanation except made up

that s great wishing her lots of luck with that
yes
sorry
so sorry a mess here in
too
yes


breaking
got her second
vaccine today yes she went out in the snow in
to get it she is a trooper feeling good so far
i can t remember who said it but that s why they call it trading and not winning
amazing
t it

i
it read it too quickly thanks
i have seen my eldest grandson


do a bit of it lately comes sooner than you think

must have
that he is not on often these days
that s the
right
i had the mute on but i think one of the fast money

d a
as his final trade
woo

registered rep or

i so look forward to the days in the not too distant future that your daughter son give you an eye roll i want to be there for it

me so we can talk about this
do we know what that
to
i am not a hockey fan but clearly i have lived in
too long now because when i see this in my
word
i think st
blues
i am not being annoying but i would suggest you
it that would be a better explanation than i can give here

yes good point

of the last
days have seen
sell off into the close weird
oh i think there is another wave to come sadly
we had younger
too by the time i got there in



how many you think will get that
whatever it


we
t deliver
by the time i got there broker
em unless

hey chuck
it
in a fireball
or more

i took the subway and later on when i
to the east side i took the van
wow
days

not trading
we also had a
day rule if you bought a stock you had to hold it for
days but that was when working at broker



oh yes
were expensive

yes
hah my mentor in this biz who
away about

ago at
always said he thought

was an

older than he was
we used human
not carrier

that i am old


when i got into this biz we settled
after
days i am old



which other
i thought you d left us
i think
did this another time with

like he
to hear himself speak
would your
do that i am curious



is what is it i can t say what it might be because that s just as
as
the vol of those three in the down so i just took it out
the

welcome
with
around town
good point
is that the bike s fault too
was

able to tell us how many more
of covid
what s the range been last two
like



like


excellent

and
peanut
hah good answer


how is it even possible i beat you to this
read it again slow


to




did we correct
because if we did i must have
it
we have seen some which is sad
wait you think i
that closely mostly it was enough chatter to choke a horse
mostly bullish
i don t think there was one segment on
yesterday where they
t discuss

it is extreme
is that from those who never saw it coming and were still bearish coming into

he
been
from mayor pete to secretary pete is that an upgrade
or they are temporarily suspended

that is so far outside of my purview i think i will leave it to
who want to traffic in that stuff not me

don t you hate when that

not true

you need to keep up
i
lost my mind clearly
yes but i don t want to take that out
then there is far too much rationalization
just some back of the envelope math


currently around
mil
so if i took them out of
up down volume is still


to

not great



is
most active stock think it
been

for well over a week so losing some


trin over
it is the highest reading in at least




sorry
it
trin over
i m going to go ahead and do something i hate to do i am going to rationalize an indicator all those
stocks are doing this
also what i meant two
ago when i said realization day remember that all of a sudden everyone saw it so it stopped

to me like it got to resistance and

is that your take too
it s a good reason to have that
though

with the gap fill
it


over

for the first time since

i
got nothing of value to add there
good question my guess is probably not
hey am i doing this right dow up

i think you are taking the chatter a bit too seriously

please do not use that language with me if you do not like my
or my perspective the
button is right there have a nice day
how much is it down from the high
rut not happy today
what this market needs is an
with the ticker
or a

could be but it s hard to say on a commodity
they have them often and the underlying commodity might not have it
read this morning s piece it might help explain
are not
and usually not analysis just

i have been calling for a correction in
since
week of
my
morning piece said oversold rally coming this week intermediate term still not great so not sure what part you are
to

was lovely and did a great job
not all
this is true
i beg to differ i think the
of

ago have learned much from the fall out back then
if nothing else the last week or so of trading will teach many how
work
yes well if you don t understand the mechanics of the market
met him once was nice to me
stocks fluctuate ace
after the
crash

i have been
one and said no if you want one you should have one
wait while i get my
face


up volume highest since



yes but have to do the actual math

closed at



stocks advancing on
today not sure i have ever seen a
handle on the

in my case mean
hah
yes
haven t decided yet
face lift
doing my
now and i
say today
like new month new money very index driven
sorry i don t know where to find it and besides i have no reference for what it would mean
sorry i don t really track
am a fan of bank index since it is pure
yes thank you
was that the name of the song stick it to the man
yes thank you
i am drawing a blank need some help here there was a broadway show several
ago with a song something like stick it to the man i feel like or will know it took place at

as a thread so we can easily follow along thanks

i
d at that
still one hour to get your vote in
there is no average over
too bullish single
too bearish
it is subscription based
whether it
or not all that hate out in the open is a societal issue
too much hate is just not good for anyone but that s my view
jeff is good people
it s a society problem first
yes but read it he
even if

red
daily sentiment index high
too bullish low folk too bearish

who perpetuate hate should have a look at themselves first
cant remember but neutral
jeff covered it this week
we
early this week herb had it yesterday afternoon
get it
long the

are bullish silver
i think there was a peak that year but thought it was summer

chili crunch you can use trader joe s it is different but similar enough
speaking of citron i find myself looking at

t even consider that
what is this red stuff on my screen
hah too high priced each box would be like

or whatever they are
so no thank you
true now what

been flat for a week or more lottery is more fun now
i m
play
in the
millions
and i love it
i
done the hide thing but then a day later someone
it all over again seriously don t these people have anything else to do with their
i mean they could come to twitter and chatter
someone sent a group text to me and

i don t even care about what they are
and my phone
buzzing
rude to ask them to remove me
not here cash only
send your

you
be in it to win it used to be their slogan so how many
are you
sam
first call wow are they still around
company guidance research i remember it




true story

ago we used to send a runner
to physically pick up
s earnings that s how important the company was they
t even
it out back then




volume of the year
thank you

consider mine to always be a spoof
tweet is unavailable no idea what you want to show me
that s all i



the why
t matter the result does
closed at

in august
incentive



in fairness
it at

at
no one

i can t wait to see how many like it now

you re talking to me an old they used to report in the middle of the day on a regular basis
it s like an

announcement
let s face it those
million are just chump change we re here for the
mil

every market
a king and queen or something similar
not available
he and
are the man right now
thank you
the stock market s rally to a record on stimulus and vaccine
leaves little room for error
earnings are in

earnings are not til

anyone know why
is so strong today




and
in one

millions is
night
interesting
yet it
up as
on the chart not sure about what the difference is
my poll was

up to down
that reading was
on the chart
he needs to be at those revolutionary war

it
like it might be the highest on record
so when they become profitable

exposure

they used to have self
know why they stopped too much theft seriously people are

i always cry when i sell too soon i cry a lot
always own too much when they are down never enough when they are up
smart will you pick me up a ticket for
while you re out


reversal

volume is

to the upside
i dont mind him being bearish or bullish right or wrong my issue with him is that he
a tendency to lie about his
that s it
interesting
winning


t even bother to take a breather at the gap fill
right mine too
been tiny for a while
hah

it s an island
cost
which is fine now but once
come back
go inside

like
is the only big bank to fill the gap so far


in a week
bank index
in a week
pillow talk
today
a bit like a realization day
what does that mean i have no idea
what s
to
i was just thinking that as i did the math that my insurance
are
since he came into office and said he had a plan for us in two

thanks everyone for the education really appreciate it
thank you kindly sir
thank you
i don t follow
very closely and the chart
funky to me but
it given up its
gains can someone confirm or not to me please

yes but
hi dan are you saying it s an either or market
i don t mean to blow your
off i write a daily column for where i explain these
which cannot be done in a tweet or a

i do not have
also i think
is very flawed and therefore check in on it but do not use it unless it is confirmed with other sentiment
i use



up volume

it s not absolute
in my house we have to hide bread on the kitchen counter from the cat she
to chew through the bag to get to it
she leaves alone
rut down

ann

wow bad take dom
sad do you change it when it s on wrong
the back is just wrong everyone
that
the
or the data the data is at
dot

i know everyone doing the

thing but i would be


do you think my
are the young
i m
go with no i m too old and slow for them
pull it back a little and they look nothing alike

useful as a
indicator
like a gold star on the

survey is



and it is only my opinion
is useful when it is confirmed by other sentiment

not that i know of



since election
highest since then as well similar to the
of my
poll
wild that they
to finance them
red
just calling it out
it was
bank index was read
really i find that hard to believe

was red



him her
ago waste of time
reiterated it today but down first
stop
dial up


no pullback of consequence
would be a lot he

risk assets

coming up on

ladies would you want to rip the high
off first or the mask tough call
up down volume on the
is flat


not really breadth
crummy and net volume negative
and
since my poll
is that a victory lap

ugh sorry to hear in that respect



you are on fire today with these
do you have any decent


i love these
sad
it

i think today is the day

t give up the early gains

cash back to
s low
we want
not second best we can do better


cash on the

pretty good spread there mark
i have a sense we are going to see this one from you often in the days

ahead

from this week or even the one from
they reference

well more like

to the player where they should have one we have just not seen this before where one issue
three
the data

would need to figure out how to account for that unlikely they will
they are doing it to the ad they have to for

breadth is terrific today just shy of

at least
took down the
bull reading from their site still
this week s reading
there ya go
what if time is on your side
i don t know the answer to that


t me unless i
someone else s

from

once i get them will gladly post
where did you get the
reading not up on their site yet



blake where did you get that their site still

which is
incorrect

thanks now we need them to send out this week s if you see them please let me know

oh i m not sure we can say that i think the participation in the

now
then is quite different

are much more widely used for all
of hedging now
fun fact
dow wrote the dow theory as an economic theory not a technical one
yes i know i am the
but this daily
tweet is like my daily bank index tweet last summer



working on fourth straight green day i might faint


we
t have cost in shanghai when i was there perhaps they have one now

appreciate it
well it s nice someone
me since i have been
over the
in recent days thanks for the
up
one example here in the us we gather our

they weigh em at
there you push and shove to get em weighed in the

same with fruit and fish
thanks appreciate the
up
i used to shop at
when i lived in shanghai was let s say a different sort of shopping experience
as
one shorts weakness not strength
this is re the consecutive

for equity put call ratio
thank you so much

oh look another
in our midst
if you call yourself a libertarian to support your
on hate speech you should
me now because it is likely you will be blocked sooner or later


right so it
no sense to compare

are different now thank you
it s clearly a mistake they will fix

i did not say anything about
so do not put
in my mouth
i am not going down this road with you
i think you should probably
me now

but i do not rationalize

maybe can confirm that we have never seen this
equity put call ratio at
two straight days i don t believe we have ever seen that
there is a change from


in
there
only been
reading over

since the calendar turned
streak since summer
not even close to
s
yet though
thank you

i will chose to be hopeful


i m afraid to click
i suggest you read what was written and judge for yourself whether that garbage should be

did you read that though it is gut




bullish this week i m
go out on a limb and say there s a problem there
i read this and i am both sad and
for our country
no i don t why should i

thank you will check it out
what s more remarkable is that
of the volume on
yesterday was on the upside
was about

it s the same as when people who
t live
the crash of
shrug like it was a great
opportunity if you lived through it your view is quite different
exactly you really just don t forget when you experience it yourself
i think i
about it around then too did a thread on what it was like when i was in shanghai during
i never thought it would be like it is but i think once you live
something similar it
t leave you
sorry i can t read that
i m going to throw the chart up so all can see what you mean also i had to change to arithmetic scale or you can t even see the move
i m sorry i don t understand the question are you

breadth almost

today
well i saw yours just above this in my
which is why i


is that your translation
they do breadth
nothing like
so not sure how you can say that
market at its
and it s not even sub

why

t go down
it s a serious question
actually he should do a

not


like
is the most active stock every day have not checked to be sure but it s like every day i look and it is at the top
air

i vow to try harder in the future
i had to
her
awesome
i am enjoying the
volatility



is good people

an indicator


have you tried peanut butter





report

are all about corn the row not so much i have an
friend who
never had such
as



my entire
discovered corn
rut still

please see my pinned tweet
i actually
my

this year for the first time since
now i swear i can t remember the darn thing
there will be a reality show made from this

know when the guy with the fireplace goes to all cash
law and order
better late than never

cash

days
you must be new around here i am the

quickly
who
bullet proof

green day something it

in a month
fed
in may market topped in march so no
unless i should be concerned about my husband
oh what do you think
i
and have for the last nearly

think i m

the
rally
i
that when he wrote it up thinking it was terrific

i like that i have a boatload of old

i dont know what to do it
more like signal decline

even i think it is ridiculous that i keep my
in this tiny little notebook now maybe not so much
we all have
and
for my part i just hope i can learn from each mistake but also from each winner
yes
you mean like an item of news that crossed the tape
t one
they are probably paying
to a fa to put their money in an

my old
say all
during or just prior to
of higher volatility
horse and buggy

and
but they were

today s
who

yes
that s so

this is truly awesome for those who can t wait to point out that
was
in the


all i am
is how similar the
are
now that the stock is
they like it please see my pinned tweet
eventually they will be able to go on long
and there will be

everywhere but it s not likely in the next

anyway that s my take
like a golf cart

rev i think we both know there is a difference and you re just trying to be cute with that reply
it really is and call it whatever you want to but they are in chat

does anyone ever wonder how many of those
the
stocks actually own an
car
is raising money and its stock got cut why its

fall via

right





look who you are explaining that to i am a girl with a pencil




even get an honorable mention like we are

sad
discord and other social media
are becoming the new wall street trading

thank you also i love that you have a notebook you still keep
yes i think she got lucky but who


did not mention
yes
she went on line
and
up at the local hospital
yep



just
to
she is feeling fine and is looking forward to her second shot the first week of
she got the


had the pleasure of blocking many today

yes
and most had a last fling in late

on a drive two
ago i saw double decker container
long
something i haven t seen in

i live right near there just so odd to see one on a city street

the pencil knew
drawer trade stick in the draw and pray
but but but they said stocks go down with

not sure
blame

where does losing twitter account fall
not good


to get this green
really
the bank index is green
but you said since the march bottom and that
t what the chart
unless i misunderstood you
saw that
wait what was june to
then
the state

he s leaving
the year is so young

his
starting to hear of secondary

getting theirs now too
like the
are getting
up
oh yes

perfect
smart
i had a beanbag chair when i was a
so did my sister what s old is new again
there should be a

with the ticker

how is
not on twitter
when will they have time to spout off in front of the
unacceptable
last year at this time the fund had


in assets in just the last week it
over

incredible


new year comes late this year so they can do it a few times before then
both
and
have more than
of the volume on the upside today
we
see
i wonder if all these

publicly that they will no longer give money to
will be so public when they resume


a better day than




was he bearish in
last year
bond
never like stocks come on we know that
i believe jeff is the king now
market
as the bond king
is he bullish
seriously i don t need crap like that in my life
i do remember with a squirt of liquid on it
on trade news surely
i might block you if you keep this up
you should know in advance if you spew nonsense about covid or the vaccine you get an automatic block
so much for the unity talk
great analogy

to me that
is red on a daily basis is the first step toward finding a bottom in the stock everyone needs to see it

straight day of gains right here i prefer

i say this all the time but let me repeat that each time as i listen my mind
of
and invariably by the end either you are

that question to me that s what
your
good all about me y know
it is but right here in the city unusual

during my morning exercise and it did not disappoint good interview

when i plan mine i will contact you




no it s because everyone needs to wear a mask until we have herd immunity

thank you
so kind of you
this was terrific thank you
i think i did one or two starting in
do not think i did it in march but my memory
what it used to be
thank you for
the weekly poll in a chart
interesting
i am simply
which
more i don t want to use bubble so i don t know more extreme
poll
i think the last time the majority was down was right around thanksgiving after the
had two down
as always thank you so much for

but it s not as clear in present as it
in hindsight
why him why not my senator
always choose outdoors always
so it s all your fault right
actually i agree with what you said
every one of the major
had an outside week
less than an hour to vote
i don t let excel lift it automatically i just go and do it myself

nope

taking an exercise break see you later with more

also
my
scales to

more liquid
there were zero new
on the
yesterday

and thank you i will find
i have stated that but i also don t want to change the methodology now
oh you
analysis i write a daily column for that these are


saw

who wore it better sorry excel does not offer log only arithmetic scales


don t forget to vote

some
on top
you do know when they
with that yahoo s market cap is more than the
of
stuff it was the end in
or when the imperial palace land was worth more than
or something like that

breadth was in a death spiral not the case today so if it is a top it is a different one
almost like there is a short
long

trade

straight green
it really
become the



and
need to announce they will make

yes
there s nothing rotten coming to

i believe you are correct
i do not but as you can tell i have become fascinated by it

how bad it is we are on the road to finding a bottom
right but
and
heavily weighted

this chart to my guess is he would love it
my grandmother would say the pot is calling the kettle black
it really is not a
matter

there are far too many
in this world sadly

well he typically
market
those are two i recall from this year because he
off his area of
he should have stuck to market
he s good and
about stuff he
t know about but that s my opinion
it s

it s

it s

it s so
he did an entire piece in
about how the virus would go away then he did an entire piece

how trump would win

i feel really old reading this thread
but what about the trade war

sorry got the exact title wrong
the market seldom
about politics

ago
hey walter any
on the late
smalls

they will have

compliance

high for the


up volume on the

sorry to hear

please keep your political
to yourself thank you very much

to buy
energy is up today but but but i thought we were going to be

by like year end
i am sorry clearly i
him at some point
t mean to get you in the middle

he read it on the
so it must be true


i had an

in college probably
me

no idea who is that
if today s breadth
it will be the best day since


interesting do you like how i knew that date





curious as we had just come off a big low a month prior interesting
what would it know i am curious
yes but would love to see those two side by side
feel like it s same chart
the bag is excellent better than parchment

like your ism chart from
least i think it does
good
kitchen tip when pounding chicken
use the wax bag from your cereal instead of plastic wrap works great
why are you yelling at me
this was rhetorical

remind me why the market sold off yesterday
i love this thread i think it s great thanks for

you


thanks

and

oh

market
on

joining

peachy
not yet

millions is over
million power ball is over
million i might have to buy a ticket
let us know when you get to


i think it is great they are getting involved
they sort of remind me of the sweat pants of the
with a bit more shape to them barely
another
i m not sure i like this jogger look for pants in

this is more like low priced speculative season
if you look at the most
yesterday you can see that
was the most active with

the volume of
that s why i say speculative
well the small
would have to have a lot of volume
that s not my understanding of the

i think it
there is a lot of speculation out there but i m just guessing
a sub
trin for
used to be a rare event in the last six
we have seen
of them
i have a button that
cash to burn will find a match

everyone
to have an egg view



they clearly do not know about


oh before
is out for sure
yes tomorrow i will forget i am certain of it



guess they forgot the whole separation of church and state thing
new year new page in my notebook i even wrote the date correctly
no idea

and


probably but at least i will feel i am doing the right thing with that


seen this yet
please let s try for
compliance getting
is good
not yet


spent his life
this is no different


i think i might start a thread with this sort of stuff
she
t even tell us that past performance is no guarantee of future success h t


he did he
learned how to perfect the ask
up to down volume on
is currently
to
yes up to down
still
t give him the right to make
like that
i really want to know if he was long
for the big move up out of the range
if he was he needs to be here on the
as a
member


poor thing he
to skip the
open

that s great
like her or not and she is controversial she is one of the

breadth not so bad
he
until the
came home

thanks



individual grand slam
over the course of her career

none so maybe he should

definitely not awful breadth

are weird
not a big difference



trin is

trin is
not a typo
this lady s red dress on
she s a bit um

that

came quickly in favor of the minority
yep
back at my desk
the
eater never
tired of winning

same price it was in

thank you

new line on
but quite the run since the
got to single
in late


as always is an excellent read i
this line in particular
two
one is from

ago one is current
wait i am certain i have a button for that
look
this one will do

down
in a week

reversal in oil this morning

am
t bad either at least by then they have gotten the stuff off the trucks and it s fresh as can be
this is excellent
secret
like






on the mention
wild
progress
think that is true for most

dumb rule law
well i don t walk around with mine but i do write one or two every now and then
do you feel like a dad failure or are you

mike there were

for one or


that far back
i don t care about football but i don t live in those



another brave soul although
early morning is not bad it s later in the day that it s a madhouse
happy birthday
just when i thought i was out they
me back

on a weekend is true courage
i just love that they put it on a flyer on a windshield

now that is annoying
so is mine but certain
still require them
it s like charting by hand
i wrote a check today and wrote
on it i am
of myself
it is at the


of the
poll thank you everyone for
and thank you
for charting it for us let s have a great year
up
down
not everything you read
i must do something now more often than not it is informational
that s what i
too thank you happy new year
it is a divergence
that s not actually true
vote early but not often

to go
i love it
not at all it s at the

nope but you can go look at the

and see if it
the
you want
never saw it that high
then my goal in
will be to get to


breadth is at the
so it
t
that is my interpretation as well
i would add one tidbit about

the breadth of the market was horrific it peaked in
and went into a death spiral in

breadth
a downward spiral in


it
it s


would be the first down expectation in about



exposure
backed off
ask


maybe more like anna
but you have to be a real tennis
to understand that one

poll the next

for the s
p



panic euphoria
backed off a bit
this
skew really
my attention it
to go down
good
morning i did much of the chart fest yesterday so here s the link today i will add a few
from
s
this is worth your time to read carefully to understand so many
of the market and trading

with one c not two
only if we get down close to it
the case of the missing

it s chili
sure but in general you will find that at
you think view
different than you did at
and at
you will see it differently than you did at

that s just the way life works we all become our
no matter how hard we try not to
would love to share with you maybe next year
megaphone is actually
a
top and there is not one present on that chart

i get it there is a lot you don t realize until you actually get there

human nature
t change
is it
i
t know i will look thank you

would go up again in my lifetime
i like internals over price and momentum but i am old
so
i know someone else




never
of it til i
to st


a chili sort of day
if you see the pic of what it s like here you will love yours even more

well i thought what you thought too until i dug think it was like
of the
new
were either
or
funds
nice catch
there ya have it
not true i did an entire tweet storm on it about a week ago well over
of the
new
were
s
every single time i play a seasonal trend i lose
it
t it s my travel sharpener but when i used it this week i thought gosh it is o much better than my stay at home one so i am officially switching

this is amazing
me nope
i also want to give an environmental

will give you some money for your old
